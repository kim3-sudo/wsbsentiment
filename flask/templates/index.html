            <p><b>what is r/wallstreetbets?</b></p>
            <p>r/wallstreetbets is a subreddit for wannabe day traders who try to get rich on meme stocks like lucid motors (NASDAQ:LCID), tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), bed bath and beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), blackberry (NYSE:BB), nokia (NYSE:NOK), palantir (NYSE:PLTR), and virgin galactic (NYSE:SPCE). their investments are not based on logic. their investments are based on memes and the promise of free tendies.</p>
            <p><b>what is tendiebot?</b></p>
            <p>tendiebot is a no-code interface to use a <span class="rainbow-text">neural network</span> and some <span class="rainbow-text">machine learning</span> and <span class="rainbow-text">artificial intelligence</span> to break down what the hell r/wallstreetbets is talking about.</p>
            <p><b>what makes tendiebot different from other natural language tools?</b></p>
            <p>r/wallstreetbets uses a unique vocabulary that is not encapsulated in any other dataset or online community. there's not much data on r/wallstreetbets compared to tweets, news stories, books, or other datasets. tendiebot has been specially trained to work with r/wallstreetbets and only r/wallstreetbets.</p>
            <p><b>how does tendiebot work?</b></p>
            <p>tendiebot uses <span class="rainbow-text">machine learning</span> to analyze r/wallstreetbets. to get free tendies, tendiebot uses a <span class="rainbow-text">transformer neural network</span> to generate a post that looks like something that might be written on r/wallstreetbets. it then uses a <span class="rainbow-text">naive bayesian classifier</span> to analyze the post for how positive or negative it is. if it's positive, then tendiebot will give you the stock advice. if it's negative, then tendiebot will try to make another post using the <span class="rainbow-text">neural network</span> until it gets a positive post. if you don't know what r/wallstreetbets just said, tendiebot can use the <span class="rainbow-text">naive bayesian classifier</span> to get the sentiment of the post. just give tendiebot the post text and tendiebot will tell you whether it likes it or not.</p>
