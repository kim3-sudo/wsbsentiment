      "41122 SPY AMD QQQ F Apple VIX Daily TA\n",
      "    The day before CPI the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my 2 red day If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20 50 and 100emas We finally got the close below them today While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days   The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today To color me impressed would be an understatement Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesnt have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema above for bearish and below for bullish    httpspreviewreddit1hpw0uyrqzs81pngwidth97  We actually established yet another downward channel today that I dont suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse    httpspreviewredditnzmwaslsqzs81pngwidth97   httpspreviewredditli7lzt7tqzs81pngwidth97  We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse   But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow I dont really forsee unless CPI truly is like 95 or 10 that we do it but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431   httpspreviewredditgk5l6gstqzs81pngwidth97  The daily chart is something of beauty to me As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now    httpspreviewreddit14m0bnhuqzs81pngwidth97  The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now Today we not only opened below the 20 50 and 100 ema on the daily 44521 44655 and 44663 but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it I would be very surprised again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside   Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 unlimited upside BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY Of course I dont suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow    httpspreviewredditb7xoaqpvqzs81pngwidth97  Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within However we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema 44396 4459 The next support for the weekly puts us near 4353 weekly 50   Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday monthly option expiration   Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls 16k at 437p   Thursday monthly has 15k 445c 55k 450c Otherwise 121k 440p 66k 435p 113k 430p  That is a massive amount of OI to the downside thats expected this week alone With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week Perhaps we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430 The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too   With the last CPI being 75 expected at 79 but the consensus at 84 its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow But with this being the first CPI with war gas prices more covid etc I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 85 to 9 I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow    httpspreviewredditzvve2nvwqzs81pngwidth97  Apple had a heck of a red day today too mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2774 today I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema I did not however expect it to happen today However I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning   Apple now is in an interesting place Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158 However my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again Apple is a risky play here   Channel support tomorrow is 157 unlimited downside and resistance is 1666 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 1686 would be a bullish signal However if Apple loses 16554 daily 100ema we can expect further downside this week   I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning Before the small intraday recovery I may reenter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish    httpspreviewredditrvihq1qxqzs81pngwidth97  The blood for AMD just continues but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive 52 hit which I believe it was down around 6 at one point intraday I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100 This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 7274 This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right   I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema tomorrow most likely to form an official death cross This should give it some continued downside    httpspreviewreddith42lt6cyqzs81pngwidth97  Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 25 however after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in Next major support I see for Ford is around 128 and after that is 112  Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I dont suspect the RSI to be an issue   Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position    httpspreviewreddit26yjjyxyqzs81pngwidth97  QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how   Channel support is 322 unlimited downside and resistance is 342 for tomorrow   I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20 50 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema I called out on SPY that 420430 was support I suspected I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ    httpspreviewredditqghek3jzqzs81pngwidth97  The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today From low to high covering 11 from its low of 2209 pre market to its high of 2342 during power hour Overall

Full disclosure I'm not involved in this market.   Papa powell lowered fed rates to almost 0 during the beer virus and printed paper so there were lots of easy money. This money first went into stonks and the market became too hot. Institutional investors had to find an alternative asset class and it seemed like they went into real estate.   As you have noticed the housing market went crazy over the last few years. However I also noticed this insane price hike is mostly for starter homes  aka the houses for entrylevel buyers getting their first home. These starters are singlefamily housesapartmentsduplexescondostownhouses you get the idea. In contrast my older wealthy friends' gt$1M mansion had seen maybe 300k increase while the starter houses my younger friends are looking to buy increased by x2 or x3.   Investors instead of home buyers purchased gt18 of all real estate sold in Q3 2021 alone.redfin.comnewsinvestorhomepurchasesq32021. Firms like BlackRock has bought 66 apartment complexes in my city  not units entire complexes. I also looked at the prospectus of two REITs Vanguard VNQ and BlackRock USRT and residential is the secondhighest holding in these funds. The top holding is something called Specialized REIT  I wonder if apartment complexes or residential RE holding companies count as such. In both funds' documents they identified increasing interest rates as a significant risk factor. The point is this is just two REITs. There are lots more of these institutional or even individual investors of various sizes buying up starter homes.    With all that said I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on where this is going and how it will end. The following is my speculation and thinkingoutloud so probably not everything makes sense   It seems to me like these institutions are cornering the market by controlling the supply and causing the price to increase and then slowly selling these starter houses to any sucker who would be willing to pay the ridiculous price ... so are they holding a bunch of empty houses waiting for appreciation or are they also renting them out How are the occupy rates   Switching gears  what about the packaging and reselling of these mortgages Anything going on there I know they never stopped selling CDOs.printfriendly.compgmKya3x after 0809. Like the film ending scene of 'the Big Short' pointed out they are now making 'boutique synthetic CDOs'  and call them 'bespoke tranche opportunity' and there's a lot of activity in product.reuters.comarticleidUSL5N22B5Q2.   As interest rates start to increase are institutions gonna fire sale and try to make their rival firms and new home buyers hold the bag I'm not sure of the exact cause or mechanism but if they needed to cooperate and hold it all together they wouldn't  just look at how they handled Bill Hwang's swaps. They all agreed to slowly unwind but right after the meeting when Credit Susse and UBS went to sleep Goldman and Morgan immediate offloaded and tanked those stonks and market in general. That's relatively small in comparison to the entire housing market.   Anyway I would love to hear your opinions thoughts and insights on this. Thanks for reading my rant.\n",

      "    The day before CPI the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my 2 red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days.   The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesnt have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema above for bearish and below for bullish.    httpspreview.redd.it1hpw0uyrqzs81.pngwidth97  We actually established yet another downward channel today that I dont suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse.    httpspreview.redd.itnzmwaslsqzs81.pngwidth97   httpspreview.redd.itli7lzt7tqzs81.pngwidth97  We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse.   But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I dont really forsee unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10 that we do it but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.   httpspreview.redd.itgk5l6gstqzs81.pngwidth97  The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now.    httpspreview.redd.it14m0bnhuqzs81.pngwidth97  The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20 50 and 100 ema on the daily 445.21 446.55 and 446.63 but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside.   Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 unlimited upside BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I dont suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow.    httpspreview.redd.itb7xoaqpvqzs81.pngwidth97  Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema 443.96 445.9. The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 weekly 50.   Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday monthly option expiration.   Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p.   Thursday monthly has 15k 445c 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p 66k 435p 113k 430p.  That is a massive amount of OI to the downside thats expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too.   With the last CPI being 7.5 expected at 7.9 but the consensus at 8.4 its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war gas prices more covid etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow.    httpspreview.redd.itzvve2nvwqzs81.pngwidth97  Apple had a heck of a red day today too mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today. I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not however expect it to happen today. However I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning.   Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here.   Channel support tomorrow is 157 unlimited downside and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However if Apple loses 165.54 daily 100ema we can expect further downside this week.   I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may reenter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.    httpspreview.redd.itrvihq1qxqzs81.pngwidth97  The blood for AMD just continues but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive 5.2 hit which I believe it was down around 6 at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 7274. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right.   I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema tomorrow most likely to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside.    httpspreview.redd.ith42lt6cyqzs81.pngwidth97  Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5 however after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.  Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I dont suspect the RSI to be an issue.   Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position.    httpspreview.redd.it26yjjyxyqzs81.pngwidth97  QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how.   Channel support is 322 unlimited downside and resistance is 342 for tomorrow.   I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20 50 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.    httpspreview.redd.itqghek3jzqzs81.pngwidth97  The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11 from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels but mind you that was on the downside not the upside.    httpspreview.redd.it1dkbfa40rzs81.pngwidth97  When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI.   Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising 30 year fixed mortgages rising again the inverted treasury yields inflation covid war gas etc. etc. etc. recession etc. etc. etc. talks  up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two.   While some dont think its a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of... took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling thats the pr to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow.   10 challenge  Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19 a spy put for 20 and a call for 20. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70 at open that spiked to 30 around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at 30. I also played a call and put for 25 then 10 during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10 puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal however factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.\n",

      "Gapped up and gapped down stocks  good strategy potential\n",
      " Does anyone here currently use after market gap analysis to identify stock likely to shift dramatically on market next day open  Here's the basics   Gapping occurs when the price of a stock or another asset opens above or below the previous day's close with no trading activity in between. A gap is the area discontinuity in a security's price chart. Gaps may materialize when headlines cause market fundamentals to change rapidly during hours when markets are typically closed for instance the result of an earnings call afterhours.  Gapping may also refer to the difference or spread in rates at which banks borrow and lend. The dynamic gap measures how assets money held and liabilities money loaned change over time.  Here's a good example from last week  HP Inc NYSE HPQ stock price gapped up 18.6 after Warren Buffett revealed that Berkshire Hathaway had acquired 121 million shares�.  This lead to this early jump in price   formatpn     You can use sites such as barchart.com to run gap up and gap down stock analysis to identify potential targets for profits out of the gates on markets open.  More often that not a gapup will encourage a 'buy' and gapdown will encourage a 'sell'.  However you need to gauge the momentum behind the stock and trend to decide what is the appropriate strategy to deploy however as a simple start point gap circumstances can roughly be categorised as such  1. A breakaway gap Sell short and place a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. 2. An exhaustion gap  prices pull back into it the next day The downtrend is over Cover shorts immediately. 3. Another exhaustion gap marked by a lack of new highs after the gap Several days of churning offer good shorting opportunities with a stop above the high. 4. A continuation gap in a downtrend Go short with a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. Prices hit that stop a few days later  no method is failsafe. 5. An exhaustion gap closed two days after it opened Cover shorts immediately. 6. A common gap in the midst of a congestion area closed the next day No action recommended. 7. A breakaway gap Go long and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. 8. A continuation gap Add to longs and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. The gap at the right edge of the chart could be either a continuation or an exhaustion gap. Relatively quiet volume suggests continuation. If you buy place a protective stop a few ticks below the lower rim of this gap.  In the HP example above this was a breakaway gap with sufficient indicator and fundamental analysis to tell you this was a 'BUY'.  In any case a good solid strategy to nail down and add to the arsenal.\n",
      "This guy wont take delivery of his egg future contracts. What to do shitpost\n",
      "So I've done some work for the poultry industry in the past.  Because of the bird flu scare they wanted to unload a ton of eggs quickly at cut rate costs.  They reached out to me because they know I am on WSB and do some day trading.  I saw this opportunity and agreed to sell some futures contracts.  I ended up selling the agreed upon allotment of DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures.  Turns out I probably could have sold those contracts for way more than I did but we farmers and I wanted to make sure the eggs would move before they went bad.  I only took a 5 cut and the rest goes to the farmers so every contract sold did ok.  If we held out a little longer we could've cleared at least another 20 or more.  Needless to say the farmers have had to massacre their chicken stocks because of the bird flu.  So this one guy that we sold some contracts to wanted more.  Despite being over capacity the farmers wanted to sell more to make up for the fact they were making less per egg.  The farmers coop accepted his contract offers and we'd make more eggs.  This meant all of us myself the farmers and their kids etc. would have to put in the OT to make sure we filled this order.       Now the buyer of the contracts is saying he was messed up when he bought the contracts and cant take physical delivery of the final 10 contracts because of the size of his storage location.  A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs.  A tonne of eggs is anywhere between 1086 and 1736 dozens of eggs.  In total we are talking about over 1 million eggs.  How do you buy a contract and not know that you do not have appropriate storage let alone 10 contracts  Also for reference a chicken will lay one egg per day if youre lucky.  To fill this over sized order we were sitting there jacking off roosters for a week straight to get all of the chicken jizz and then had to finger every hen to knock them up to get the eggs made.  If you turn on a black light in my place you'd go blind and I have a few roosters following me around and sending me chocolates and flowers.     What should I do  I need this guy to take the damn eggs.\n",

Everything was in the red so it was pretty realistic and I started scrolling down my portfollio showing him some of the stocks I own.  I then got to NOK. And as we looked at it it went up to $20. I said that's unusual for a stock to go up that much in just a short time and no sooner had the words left my mouth did it go to $40. And then I got interested and it went to $80. So I was buying like a fucking t on chips and it went all the way to $254. Stayed around the $250 mark for a couple of minutes and then went back down to about $116 before eventually going all the way back to the start I obviously did not sell in time.  Anyway.

      "Last week I said that SPY was going to slope down with nothing crazy that happened except my 5 day forecast got inversed.  The days that I thought would be bearish were actually bullish.    I was thinking about this and noticed how there is hundreds of ways the week could play out  that would result in SPY going down.    I am still going to continue the 5 Day Outlook because it is something funny to do just take it with a grain of salt because it is seriously impossible to predict every single day before the futures market even opens... I write these Saturday morning.     1 Day Chartformatpn  The main levels have been the same for about a month now  Support 432  Resistance 452  The RSI is showing the K approaching an oversold reading there will at least be a short term relief in the selling pressure overall  1 Day Chartformatpn  I would classify the bollinger band with as a somewhat mean reverting indicator to get a sense of the overall volatility.  Since the bollinger bands have a relative wide span we can assume that we will likely be entering a phase of lower volatility.     CPI Data Release Dateformatpn  Everyone is going to be watching the CPI data when it is released on Tuesday.  Remember that Ukraine was invaded February 24th so all of the effects on the global markets were felt last month in March.    All retail investors will be watching and all of Wall Street will be watching.  This is not going to be pretty...

There is nothing to be done now I am just waiting.  I still have a lot of positions open when this crash starts I will start to liquidate everything... believe me it will be very noticeable when it starts.    Federal Reserve FOMC statementformatpn  Bullard is concerned for the economy and wants at least a 50 to 75bp rate hike.  I actually found this kind of interesting because he is one of the least corrupt people in office.  He has a net worth around 5 million which is surprisingly low for having inside information.  He also has never worked with big banks and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.  He definitely knows what is going on and what needs to be done to save the economy.  The federal reserve will eventually have to become more aggressive in rate hikes.   Crude Oil CFDsformatpn  Predictions  Tuesday is going to be an extremely important day.  I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10.  Oil rose 35 in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5 which is going to shock the markets.    Another factor is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.    The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.  I hate to be that person but over the last year with unemployment decreasing spending increasing and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80 without interfering.  At most there will be a 50 bear market similar to 2008.  The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell then it should recover in the following days.

The Why  GOGO is one of the highest shorted stocks with 37.15 of the float sold short. Now you may wonder why this is relevant well it's because GOGO is looking to break through the $20 resistance where it can move up without much technical resistance and it has all the right factors going for it.  The How  GOGO is already up 87 this year and the shorts have been suffering heavily. This is the perfect moment for their positions to collapse. As the shorts will already be looking to derisk in the current market environment it gives the stock an even bigger momentum push.  Speaking about the market GOGO has been going up against it and is green during red days. It's showing what we like to call regard strength.  The Fundamental Technical  1. It was recently added to the  SmallCap 600 Index so the passive investors are all buying. This is supported by the fact that volume has exploded since. 2.

      "Making Bank Using Leverage and Options I promise its not as bad as it sounds\n",
      " If You Had To Point Out The Flaws Of The Stock Market Relative To Other Asset Classes What Would They Be  Theres a long list of them high volatility sequence of return risk low cashflow high efficiency and liquidity this could be a pro or con depending on how you look at it lack of significant leverage etc.  Out of all those things however were gonna focus on two of them. The lack of cashflow and the lack of leverage. Both of these things are abundant in real estate in particular. A good rental multifamily can be expected to have a cap rate of 712 with a cash on cash return ideally around 15 or higher. This is because 1 real estate does not rely upon appreciation solely it relies upon the income it generates from the renters and 2 investment properties typically only need a 20 down payment in order to purchase.  Thats a 51 leverage ratio which would be impossible to achieve safely in the stock market.  Now it used to be that stocks had lower appreciation and higher dividend yields however that has not been the case for 70 years at least.  You can take a look at this dividend yield chart of the  500 for reference.  formatpn   Luckily We Can Turn The Stock Market Back Into An Income Machine Using Options  This is the whole premise of the thetagang position. We replace our stock appreciation with premiums received from selling options as a sort of dividend yield.  So we turn to selling puts and calls on SPX or SPY or whatever index you prefer. Thats great but if we compare it back to real estate were still missing the essential component of leverage.  Thats where leveraged ETFs come in.  The pros and cons of LEFTs have been hotly debated but what settled it for me personally was this post by hedgefundie and this article about volatility decay If you don't want to read through all of that I've condensed down the important stuff regarding volatility decay and proper diversification in this posts__mediumweb. But basically assuming it works perhaps we can change it from capital appreciation to income generation using options.  Surely that should work right  Well it should if we do it correctly to avoid assignment as much as possible.  Leveraged ETFs suffer from something called volatility decay basically just describing the idea that a when a loss is incurred a greater gain needs to be made to square ourselves back to zero. With leverage we magnify our risk to this factor.  So because we have more vulnerability to downside lets protect ourselves using a bit of probability.   Using Standard Deviation To Calculate Probabilities  Lets just assume for the moment that all market movements are as good as being random. Yes they are based on data but if we dont have access to said data the movements may as well be random.  Under this assumption we can then also assume that there are probabilities to which direction a stock is going to move. There should be roughly a 50 chance that the stock will go up or down at any given moment.  On top of that we could also assume that larger movements are less likely than smaller movements mainly due to the fact that it takes much larger sudden inflows and outflows of cash to make a stock behave that way. Now some stocks have a relatively higher ability to make a significant move in either direction but even these stocks still have boundaries where they will be unlikely to move.  A good example of this how wild Teslas swings are relative to General Electric. Tesla has a higher relative swing compared to General Electric but even Tesla is unlikely to swing to $30 or $5000 in the next year.  Now these observations we just made are the fundamental ideas behind the concept of standard deviation.  Standard deviation essentially says that within a given time frame usually a year a stock has a certain probability of being within certain price ranges based on its volatility its ability to make wild swings like Tesla.  formatpn  As you can see at the bottom of the chart we see that at each increasing or decreasing standard deviation 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 etc there is less of a probability that our data or in this case the stock price will fall into this range given a normal distribution.  If you add up all the percentages between 1 and 1 we get a 68.2 chance that our stock price will fall in this range. This is called the first standard deviation. If we expand out the 2 and 2 then we get a 95.4 chance that our stock price will fall within the range. That is called the second standard deviation. If we go out to the 3 on each side we get a 98.8 chance that the stock price will fall within the range. With each standard deviation the chance that a stock price will fall within the range gets higher albeit at a much slower rate.   So What Does This Have To Do With Selling Options  Using these standard deviations we can get probabilities that a stock will fall within a certain range. If we use something called Implied Volatility we can figure out what the market thinks that one standard deviation is. Then using that we can predict what probability our option has of expiring in the money which is what we dont want.  To find implied volatility we can go to a website like volafy.net and get the implied volatility percentage. In the case of TQQQ QQQ leveraged 3x the implied volatility is 80 at this time of writing.  Using this percentage we can plug it into a handy formula to calculate the standard deviation for any specific option.  The formula looks like this  sqrtoption days until expiration365  implied volatility  current stock price  In written terms basically we divide the days until expiration by 365 then take the square root of that and multiply it by the implied volatility percentage and the current stock price.  That gives us the amount in dollars of the first standard deviation. If you take that amount and add it AND subtract it from the current price it will give you the range the stock will fall within 68 of the time.  Right now we are interested in selling puts on TQQQ without getting exercised so well sell at one standard deviation out of the money. At the current price of TQQQ $51.84 the first standard deviation out of the money would be $38.11 which is also 51.84  13.73.  If we go back up to our standard deviation chart we can see that on the left side of the chart the side that represents our OTM options we can add up all the percentages before the 1st standard deviation mark. This comes out to be a 15.9 that our OTM option will become ITM by expiration you might have noticed that this percentage closely correlates with the delta of the option which is a good way to gauge it as well. If we are selling monthly options this comes out to be getting assigned once out of every six months on average. To me those seem like pretty good odds.  So lets go down to the $38 strike put on TQQQ which is trading $128 per contract right now. Thats a 3.37 ROI in 40 days or 30.75 annually.  If we assume assignment three times a year that wipes out any premiums made for that given month we are still sitting on a 20.64 CAGR.   But Wait Isnt This Riskier Than Selling Puts On Regular Old QQQ  This is the beauty of it you have the same risk of getting assigned on TQQQ as you do with QQQ if you stay at the same standard deviation but still receive 3x the premium. This is because with TQQQ higher volatility we sell further OTM than we would with regular QQQ but still receive the high premiums due to it being a leveraged product.  If you do happen to get assigned no worries Personally I would recommend that you simply just sell out of the position at the current price and open a new put for the next month. The reason why I say this as opposed to selling a call is that calls do not have the same volatility risk premium that puts do and therefore do not sell for as much. If you want to read more there is this paperreprep which discusses the outperformance of a put writing only strategy that outperforms during bearflat markets. If you open a new put you are simply taking the loss for that month with the intention that the high win rate probability of this trading strategy will make you square again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS STRATEGY ON ANYTHING BESIDES INDEXES if you do chances are that eventually that stock will get wiped out and never recover I'm looking at you TLRY. Indexes on the other hand do recover you don't need to look any further than this chart to prove it.   500 Returnsformatpn  TLDR Sell puts on TQQQ way OTM instead of buying them.

      "  For those who don't remember two years ago Musk and Tesla announced his easy it was to extract lithium from clay and salt and a revolutionary new process at its 2020 battery day.  Allegedly 10000 acres of property rights in Nevada were bought noone has ever seen public land registry relating.  Even though Geochemists from established Lithium miners were unable to perform such alchemy Musk was going to of course.  Yet here we are again with Musk talking up Tesla's entry into Lithium mining.  At least it seems some in the media are finally at least keeping track of the embellishments and hype if not directly daring to cite the BS.  Anyone who has actually done a little homework on Lithium mining will know contrary to popular media reports that many far better informed Geochemists have tried and failed similar techniques that Musk is citing as far back as the 1920's.  To get the salt to react with the lithium silicates requires heating it to 1000 degrees centigrade.  The energy required makes it ridiculously uneconomical versus traditional brine extraction processes.  The Pied Piper continues to play his tunes.\n",
      " Can I refuse delivery on 50 tons of Egg futures \n",
      "So I went a bit overboard with DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures. I took a bunch of drugs and my friend had a bird and idk why but it made me think a Bird flu strain coming this year so I got a shit ton of contracts.   Turns out I hit the lottery as farmers across the nation massacred their chicken stocks cuz of bird flu. I got in at about 3750 a contract and cashed out at 4400.   I apparently did not get all of my Contracts out and now I have people contacting me saying I need to take physical delivery of 10 contracts. A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs  I live in an apartment I cannot take delivery of 50 tons of eggs What do I do I made a killing so I can hire whoever I need to to make this go away but can someone help me I do not want 50 tons of eggs coming to my door.  Would it be illegal for me to list delivery address as the nearest federal reserve building  For referenceperspective there are between approx 1174 and 2381 DOZEN eggs in a single ton. This puts me at approx 720000  1.2 million eggs. I am really Stressing out over the logistics of how the fuck Id ship out this amount of eggs to shelters. It would have to be SO many shelters.

      "DD short future contracts on eggs\n",
      "I believe there is artificial demand for eggs currently because of some bird flu outbreak that was temporarily pumping the price of eggs. This coupled with unusual future buying has caused the price of eggs to be much higher than it should be.  I believe there is an estimated float of 50 tons of eggs that have yet to be delivered or sold. Once these eggs are delivered the price of egg futures should tank as this will lead to a surplus of egg commodities on the market with low buyers.  I would even be confident that this 50 ton egg order isnt even going into the egg market. Which means this egg order will probably be repod or just completely lost to churn. If this happens the future price of eggs will crash because 50 tons were delivered but not sold on the commodity market. This leads farmers to believe this elevated demand for eggs will continue causing oversupply and supply shocks decreasing price despite bird flu worries.  I cant explain where Ive heard this figure of 50 tons of eggs being purchased in the market but not used in the commodity market but I assure you short future contracts will print once this order gets essentially wasted.\n",

      "Having fought this battle for decades I am pleased that the House of Representatives has done its job and set the table for success in the Senate and ultimately for the American people.  By Rep. Earl Blumenauer DOR  After working on cannabis reform for decades we hit another critical threshold Congress passed both the comprehensive MORE Act which is the gold standard in cannabis reform and my Medical Marijuana Research Act.    Make no mistake. The reason we are at this moment and poised to end the tragic unfair and misguided prohibition on cannabis is because the people got there first. Thirtyeight states have enacted medical marijuana and 18 states have determined that adult use should be legal. In total 98 percent of the population has access to some form of legalized cannabis because at the state level the fact that over twothirds of the public favor full legalization matters. While the federal government isnt there yet that too is changing.  The Senate can put these pieces inline with each other  banking comprehensive reform and research.\n",
      "Short Strangle Wheel option strategy idea\n",
      "   tldr  Wheel but you also have 100 shares of the underlying and sell Covered calls along with the Cash secured puts.  So there are many ways to describe this strategy and I don't know if others have already come up with it they probably have but I wanted to know your guys opinion on it and what you think some issues might be. It is essentially a short strangle but you own shares of the underlying and wheel it. So with the usual wheel strategy you sell cash secured puts and generate premium from that and then when assigned sell covered calls above the basis you got assigned on the puts and if its a bullish stock it will eventually pay out. This strategy works similarly except you buy 100 shares of the underlying and sell both OTM calls and OTM puts This way you can profit if the stocks go up or stays even. If you get assigned on your call its above what you bought the shares for so you make profit along with the puts you sold that expire worthless. If the stock stays between the 2 strikes it will act similarly to a iron condor and you just get to keep the premium. If you get assigned on the puts you just buy more shares of the underlying which dollar cost averages your initial shares meaning you can sell more covered calls at a lower basis to breakeven and make profit. Essentially its the wheel but you benefit if the stock stays the same and goes up but if the stock goes down it just DCAs your shares. As long as its a bullish stock and you have enough capital you can just keep dollar cost averaging your way down and the stock would have to rebound a minimal amount for you to still make profit on the shares and you keep all the premium you farmed a long the way from either side. I'm sure there is probably something I have forgotten about or not taken account so please leave your thoughts in the comments.\n",

      "The Fed controls the supply of money.  Supply and demand determines value.  Just like oil when a lot of supply goes into the market the value of oil goes down.  Same thing with money.    We do not have a demand issue.  The base economy fuckin sucks.  We have a supply issue where the Fed supplied so much money into the market they reduced the value of money and caused inflation.  Well now it's the opposite.  They will be taking out excess supply making the value of money go up to reverse the effects of inflation.  BUT they will cause a recession that may already be here.   The main component of an economy is consumer spending.  Investment government spending and net exports are the others.  Inflation is already affecting consumer spending which affects demand which eventually affects employment.  The Fed will tame inflation by removing money supply and likely overtame inflation causing a recession.  As debt service costs go up consumer demand will decrease and corporations will look to lay off people.   We are starting a nasty cycle....that will essentially lead to little or no growth for the next 5 to 10 years.   The Fed will again take too long to reverse the inflation taming.  But the problem is that we don't actually have a demand driven inflation with a robust economy...so what is the end result going to be  Deflation.    How long for I got no fuckin idea.  So we will start a deflationary process in the next 618 months and the only option will be 0 and printing money again.   Expect that within 24 months the printer goes brr again.  Yes...no one has said this yet but the Fed may cause a deflationary spiral especially if they don't act properly.   The problem is I have no idea what to do but I do know one person that does and consistently beats the market when times are tough for equities....Mr. Buffet.

      "China binds Russian business. Entrepreneurs are switching to the yuan\n",
      "As stated by money.pl   gt Sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine are pushing Russia into the orbit of Chinese influence.  Economic cooperation is tightening but Beijing plays a dominant role in this arrangement.  Dreams of a big ruble are falling aside.  Russian business is already switching to yuan billing and the Chinese are buying Russian oil and coal for their currency  gt Although Vladimir Putin dreamed of a petrublel and settlements with the West in the Russian currency the economic reality reveals this dream.  It is not the ruble but the yuan that has a much greater influence in the region and with each day of sanctions China's position will strengthen drawing Russia into an orbit of dependence and influence.  gt Russian banks have already recorded a sharp increase in the number of accounts in yuan writes Rzeczpospolita and explains that the transition to the yuan has become necessary for Russian business because of the sanctions.  gt This tendency is confirmed by a poll of the Kommersant newspaper quoted by Rzeczpospolita.  Since the beginning of the year the amount of funds in accounts in Chinese currency has increased approximately eightfold at Tinkoff Bank and fourfold at MTS Bank and Uralski Bank for Reconstruction and Development UBRD.  The same is happening at the St. Petersburg Bank where the number of these business accounts has almost 3.5fold and the number of contracts in Chinese currency has doubled.  gt Russian entrepreneurs are forced to trade in yuan.  The domestic currency is unstable and Western sanctions and Putin's decrees such as the one of March 5 prohibiting the repayment of liabilities to entities from the list of hostile countries in Western currencies make it difficult for entrepreneurs to do business with contractors abroad.  gt   China also has ambitions  at least in Asia  to dominate trade in its currency.  If you add to this the fact that the sanctions throw Moscow into the arms of Beijing's dependence the yuan will rather have a dominant role  confirmed in an interview with money.pl prof.  Dariusz Filar.  gt As Rzeczpospolita points out more Russian companies are betting on the yuan.  Among them are companies trading in spare parts textiles and food products.  The oil steel and mining industries are also starting to deal in Chinese currency.  According to the daily private Chinese companies are buying oil and coal from Russia for delivery in May and June.  gt Russia is falling more and more into the orbit of Chinese interests.  As we wrote in money.pl China is Russia's largest trading partner and although bilateral trade reached a new record of $ 147 billion last year these relations are very asymmetrical.  gt The strategic partnership between Russia and China brings more benefits to the Middle Kingdom than to Russia.  Russia is only the 15th export partner of the PRC.  In addition China has overtaken Russia in terms of trade with most Central Asian countries.  gt The situation is similar in the energy sector especially in the gas sector.  In 2014 after Russia's military intervention in Crimea when Russia received further economic sanctions from the European Union and was isolated in the West China after ten long years of negotiations suddenly decided to conclude a gas contract with it forcing the Kremlin to accept a low  delivery prices.

See previous DD  Most technical analysis techniques look at historical prices to divine future prices. This technical analysis focuses instead on the current Option Open Interest. In other words my crayons taste different.  Whenever the stock price blue touches the delta neutral line green and crosses back up it tends to go another 58.  I developed a tool which uses the entire open interest to calculate three important numbers  Delta Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option delta is 0.  Gamma Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is 0.  Gamma Maximum  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is the maximum.  The theory behind it is simple enough institutions tend to be the largest holders of short options contracts and are therefore obligated to hedge against those options contracts while collecting juicy premium riskfree.  By calculating similar numbers to what these institutions are dependent on I'm hoping to ride their coattails and earn tendies from their rounding errors.

There is no hostile takeover _is_doomed_there_is_no_hostile_takeover   Not financial advice Manage risk  I'm going to walk you through very methodically why Twitter is doomed and why Elon can't and won't save it with heavy DD. If anything he's a major catalyst to accelerate this process so I've taken the time to explain it here. I've categorized each section incase your brain is too smooth to understand one of the sections like the profit margins etc.  Also Elon's  Tweets today are ... well just look for yourself..   I keep getting comments about this  Twitter is already dead the institutions holding twitter hold it for heavy influence of the consumers. That stock and its financials don't mean much to them other than this. IMHOnfa  Gonna post this again at the top  gtTwitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules the company said in an unattributed statement. Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions. As always the statement added our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service. Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.  Yes I know it's a lie connect the dots it's easy.    Quick Recap Since April Fool's Day   Let's start here since this is undoubtedly where most of the smooth brains heard about this.  Elon took a 9.2 stake in twitter as reported  Mon Apr 4. while most of you were sleeping at 3 in the morning the stock gapped up 27 via 13G filing which is required for anyone who purchases more than 5 of a company. This publicly and officially discloses big ownership stakes.  When smooth brains heard this they thought 'wow Elon musk is in must be going to the moon' so they bought the top and pushed it up another few percent some smooth brains got out for tiny profit. Others got dumped on and got left holding the bag or sold for a loss because there was zero conviction or research into this play other than such stake much wow.  Some geniuses in this sub predicted it perfectly down to the timeline and price action how it would get dumped. Major congrats to you to being well versed in retard timelines and I hope you are still holding those puts because we've got a lot further to go down imo    Wendy's Laws of Tendies Applies   Should of simply applied  _wendys_laws_of_tendies  gt1st Law of Wendy's Mass stupidity. Assume everyone and you is retarded. The sooner you understand we are all natural born crayon eaters the sooner you are on the path to tendieland. Never trust anyone or yourself at first. If something seems retarded to you at first it's probably genius. The inverse is also true if you or others think it's genius at first glance it's probably retarded. Same thing if you see other people saying that. I don't care who they are. Do more research into it. Figure out how retarded everyone is so you can replace those crayon dinners with chicken feasts.  Now it's time to go one step further and apply  gt2nd Law of Wendy's Confusion. The more confusing and convoluted the information is the likelier it is you'll make big tendies. Big words and vocabulary you don't really understand means it's above your paygrade and therefore likely the opposite of retarded. Learn more about it and see if it's worth buying.   What Can Or Will Elon Do And What Can't or Won't He Do   I've seen a lot of next level retarded shit about Elon saving Twitter all over the internet.  Let's lay out the facts  1. Twitter is 77 owned by institutions  2. Elon is the 'single largest holder' but that doesn't mean much since you need 50.1  of a company to 'control it' 3. You cannot do a hostile take over of Twitter because of who owns it. 4. Twitter's Board in a statement put this out yes I know it's a lie they can control it point is they are not going to and they aren't there to make money directly off of TWTR     Meaning Twitter stock is worthless since the employees run the company and Elon doesn't get to decide shit. Same ownership. Same Management.  5. The CEO and the rest of the company doesn't believe in this stuff  gtParag Agrawal Our role is not to  be bound by the First Amendment but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation and our moves are reflective of things that we believe lead to a healthier public conversation. The kinds of things that we do to work about this is to focus less on thinking about free speech but thinking about how the times have changed. One of the changes today that we see is speech is easy on the internet. Most people can speak but our role which is particularly emphasized is who can be heard.  6. Elon is also capped at 14.8 ownership being a board member. But it doesn't matter because the 77 of the other institutions are not giving up their stakes. I'll get into that more later  Now that we laid out some facts lets talk about some implications of this  Elon cannot and will not change twitter in any meaningful way the company does not care about the share holders or even making money. They care about their activism. Ownership is onboard with this and is going to subsidize  like CNN etc. and continue running it in the direction that it has been going in. And even if they didn't a lot of the population will not ever trust TWTR again and a lot of the population esp on Twitter does not like Elon at all. Just look into that yourself if you don't believe me I know it's hard to believe    So what is the current direction of Twitter  Twitter is going down the tubes for a number of very important reasons.    Lets look at the financials and KPIs  First let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet  Starting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 _financials2020arFiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf  We can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue  1.37B Cost revenue  873M in 'Research and development'  888M in 'Sales and marketing'  562M in 'general and administrative'  Twitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.  Let's break this down again  Twitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent  37 on cost of revenue servers buildings upkeep etc.  23 on Research and development software engineers sociologists artists focus groups market research I believe moderators is in here as well  24 on Sales and marketing sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.  15 of general and administrative executives legal finance info tech hr consulting moderators in both categories probably customer service etc.  3 on interest and other interest on debt financing operations etc.  29 on taxes.  Yes these numbers add to 131 of revenue or in other words a 31 net income loss.  Why is Twitter so expensive to run why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money  Lets go back in time to Twitter in 20112013  Here's the same report from that time period. _financialsarTwitterInc2013AnnualReport.pdf  Page 57  Going to compare to Twitters Monthly active users MAU textAs20of20the20first20quarterdaily20active20users20mDAUdaily20active20users20mDAU.  2013 225M monthly active users MAU  Cost of Revenue  266 M 330M inflation adjusted  Research and Development. 593M 740M inflation adjustedSales and Marketing 316M 400M inflation adjustedGeneral and Administrative 124M 160M inflation adjusted  2011 100M MAU  Cost of Revenue 62M 85M inflation adjusted   80M 110M inflation adjusted  Sales and marketing 26M 36M inflation adjusted  General and administrative 233M 310M inflation adjusted  Ok so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users  2020 330M MAU  Cost of revenue $4.15 per monthly active user   $2.65 per monthly active user  Sales and marketing $2.7 per monthly active user  General and admin $1.7 per monthly active user  2013 225M monthly active users MAU numbers below adjusted for inflation  Cost of revenue $1.47 per monthly active user   $3.29 per monthly active user  Sales and marketing $1.78 per monthly active user  General and admin $0.71 per monthly active user  2011 100M monthly active users MAU numbers below adjusted for inflation  Cost of revenue $0.85 per monthly active user   $1.10 per monthly active user  Sales and marketing $0.36 per monthly active user  General and admin $0.85 per monthly active user  So what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.  Let's recap  Cost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15user in 2020 inflation adjusted 388 increase   went from $1.10user in 2011 to $2.65user in 2020 inflation adjusted 141 increase  Sales and marketing went from $0.36user in 2011 to $2.70user in 2020 inflation adjusted 650 increase  And general and admin from $0.85user in 2011 to $1.70user in 2020 inflation adjusted 100 increase  As you can see twitter suffers from huge inflated costs over the years of running their business.  I suspect this has a lot to do with financing of their servers through amortization payments.  But also trying to scale their business with the technology that was available 10 years ago and not being able to change their business model because it was bad PR to fire off thousands people and replace them with future technology they've essentially been forced to grow with their existing business modeling scaling up which you can see results in worse and eventually negative margins.  Twitter has 5500 employees 1 employee for every 60000 users  This is one of the things they fear more is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare. by their other competitors I won't mention here just yet  Facebook has all of these similar issues with growing costs and declining growth etc.  More sources  Twitters growth is slowing and stagnant   As is their profitability    And ARPUActivity Engagement  14B in Total Assets  6.7B in Total Liabilities  Net income is negative and historical trends are horrible    FCF does not look great either  Also considering censorship is Twitters product what userbase is left after that . Besides they never did anything wrong why admit that now to change it if profit is not a motive  All down the tubes. Ownership does not care employees do not care. Twitter is not about making money to them and it never will be imo    Why is Elon there then He's not stupid   You are completely right about Elon. But understand that Elon's net worth is near 300B and this is a troll purchase to him. Advertisement for his products and entertainment. He knows exactly what he is doing. The employees there are already revolting  Get it      Twitter is taking since last year to roll out a simple edit button   formatpn    TLDR   Twitter r Fuk. 1st and 2nd Law of Wendy's applies here. Elon can't and wont be saving shit even if he wants to I've got even more DD about that and Twitters competitors but I won't mention it here for now  Even if it does change the userbase and employees will revolt even more than they already are.  Inverse Cramer Inverse Cathie   Positions  I've got calls etc and shares all over on competitors  Also  TWTR May 50p  TWTR May 40p  TWTR Jun 25p  TWTR Sept 20p  Be careful though. The force of retard is strong in retail in this one. I've seen smoothers say TWTR is the next amazon and that Elon is doing a hostile takeover.  Also Institutional money has a lot vested to prop them up.  Good luck  gt3rd Law of Wendy's Diamond Hands. If you're betting around short term small movement you're going to paper hand or miss out. The best things can be volatile or daunting before doing the research. The payout has to be worth the risk otherwise you'll lose out over time even if you win more often. See that stock down 50 It might the best or the worst opportunity of your life you don't know that based on the chart alone. See that stock up 500 it might get rug pulled or keep going you just don't know and need to look into it more before FOMO'ing in or bitching out.   gt   gt4th Law of Wendy's Allocation size. Go all in and eventually you'll be homeless. Good plays don't work out and bad ones do work out. Be ready to double quadruple down or even quit with some other money. Nothing you see is financial advice including this guide for retards.   Not financial advice Manage risk     Edit I can't keep up with all of the comments  gtThere are only two outcomes the first being infinitely more likely imo   gt   gt1.Twitter is worth too much to the current owners as an advertisement for their agendas and products obviously not twitter's balance sheet itself they give up nothing and let Elon touch nothing because that billboard space is far more important for them to control. Twitter goes down the poop shoots because of competition   gt   gt2.Elon actually manages to bring about meaningful change they already said hell no see op and the userbase revolts and dips already happening \n",

While I dont have positions yet I dont hate $FB or $PYPL here.    1. Plains All American Pipeline NASDAQPAA  PAA's strength lies in its welllocated midstream energy infrastructure in the lowestcost U.S. shale basin Permian Basin. In fact it has such substantial scale and strategic positioning in the Permian Basin that Morningstar speculates that  It's not much of a stretch to state that there is a high probability that in some fashion Plains touches every barrel of oil the Permian produces earning a fee if not multiple fees.  While weakness in volumes from the basin relative to supply of infrastructure has led to poor financial results for PAA in recent years demand is beginning to recover in the basin and we expect PAA to be a big beneficiary of this trend.   Wall Street analysts seems to agree with consensus estimates for distributable cash per unit expected to improve at a 7.9 CAGR over the next half decade despite growth capital expenditures set to decline to a mere $275 million in 2022 down from $950 million in 2020.  Management is allocating the extra free cash flow primarily towards paying down debt in an effort to further strengthen its investment grade standing and set the business up to better weather any future downcycles like it experienced in 2020.  Additionally PAA has been allocating free cash flow towards equity unit repurchases  accelerating its buyback pace in Q4  and is also growing its distribution at a brisk pace just hiked its quarterly distribution by 20.8 in an effort to restore it to its precut level.   With an expected 2022 free cash flow level of $1.3 billion PAA currently offers a mouthwatering 16.5 free cash flow yield that covers its recently increased distribution by more than two times.   This  when combined with expectations of strong perunit distributable cash flow growth over the next half decade  will enable PAA to deleverage grow its distribution and buy back units at a very solid clip and should lead to outsized total returns for unitholders. \n",
      "NOK to the moon\n",
      "I had a dream last night that I was explaining my online trading account to my brother. Everything was in the red so it was pretty realistic and I started scrolling down my portfollio showing him some of the stocks I own.  I then got to NOK. And as we looked at it it went up to $20. I said that's unusual for a stock to go up that much in just a short time and no sooner had the words left my mouth did it go to $40. And then I got interested and it went to $80. So I was buying like a fucking t on chips and it went all the way to $254. Stayed around the $250 mark for a couple of minutes and then went back down to about $116 before eventually going all the way back to the start I obviously did not sell in time.  Anyway. I'm not sure of the exact time this took place so I've gone and bought shares off the back of it  937  5.33  Admittedly this isn't the best DD you'll ever read. Equally though it's not the worst.

      "Can Elon Musk purchase another 11 of Twitter in the NEAR future 11  9  Twitter board control pls any SEC rules gurus\n",
      "This might be a relatively long post but I've been looking at Delaware law and various other information sources related to this entire Elon Twitter thing. Some of this post is going to be statements and the rest is questions. I'm really hoping I can find some SEC guru that can point me in the right direction because I have questions but don't know how to google them lol. Sorry if it sounds like I don't really know what I'm talking about because honestly I don't but I would really like some insight from people who do.   This document here was signed by both the CEO of Twitter Parag Agrawal and Elon Musk. It states the following  1. Elon will become a board member. 2. Elon cannot purchase more than 14.9 of Twitter. 3. This document falls under Delaware law.  So my takeaway here is this document holds significance because it limits Elon from acquiring more than 14.9 of Twitter. From here I went to figure out why 14.9 is significant this is what I found.  This document here CTRL  F gt 15 says the following  1.  These provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.  2.  As a Delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law including Section�203 of the Delaware General Corporation law which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least twothirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such 15 or greater stockholder.  3. There's a lot more it's just too much to copy paste here.  My takeaway from this is you cannot own 14.9 rule is they're trying to prevent him from pushing for a hostile takeover. My next question was what percentage ownership do you need to force the board to listen to you this is what I found.  This document here CTRL  F gt 20 says the following  1.  4 Control including the terms controlling controlled by and under common control with means the possession directly or indirectly of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person whether through the ownership of voting stock by contract or otherwise. A person who is the owner of 20 or more of the outstanding voting stock of any corporation partnership unincorporated association or other entity shall be presumed to have control of such entity in the absence of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary Notwithstanding the foregoing a presumption of control shall not apply where such person holds voting stock in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this section as an agent bank broker nominee custodian or trustee for 1 or more owners who do not individually or as a group have control of such entity.  2. There's a lot more it's just too much to copy paste here.  My takeaway from this is that if Elon is able to get 20 of Twitter he has control over the board and they need to listen to what he says. Now a recap on what's happened in the recent days.  Elon originally started acquiring Twitter shares starting 1312022 and recently announced his position whether he did this abiding by all of the SEC rules is debatable but not the point. Right after this information came out both the current and previous CEO of Twitter made public posts welcoming Elon to the board and saying he'll be a great addition to the team. However late last night apparently Elon had a change of heart and completely went back on the contract he signed this one from above. This part is speculation but maybe Elon approached the board and said I want changes made to the way you guys handle censorship then they told him no. If Elon backs out of an agreement that basically only says one thing you cannot have more than 14.9 then wouldn't that imply he has intentions of acquiring more than 14.9 And if he's going to go for 14.9 wouldn't he just go for 20 so he has control over the board   There was a tweet Elon made saying something along the lines of expect significant improvements to Twitter in the coming months. In order for someone to make changes to the platform he would need 1 of 2 things or both.  1. A board seat which he declined. 2. 20 ownership.  All signs seem to point towards Elon buying another 11 granting him power over the board forcing them to listen to him.   The questions that I wasn't able to figure out on my own are as follows  1. Are there any SEC rules that prohibit Elon from selling the 9.1 he recently purchased in the near future Wouldn't him selling now be a deliberate pump and dump How would he be punished if he did this He knew that his purchase would increase the stock value it sounds like textbook price manipulation to just flip sides and sell now. 2. Are there any SEC rules that prohibit Elon from purchasing another 11 in the NEAR future. I understand he'll be able to buy more shares going forward now that he's voided the contract he had with Twitter but is there a time limit after just recently buying the 9.1  I tried to find the answers to these questions but I have no idea where to look. Really hoping there's some SEC guru around that can provide some insight here.\n",

      "$BBAI. The story of a bear that hates it's own kind\n",
      "I'm a straight shooter so I'll add TLDR first.  TLDR I believe BBAI to have a reduced float of 1 million shares and a short interest of 900 thousand. And is ripe for short andor gamma squeeze.   REDUCED FLOAT  If you check the float online the number you'll get is just over 12 million shares. THIS IS WRONG  Let's first start with total outstanding shares. Which is 135566227 shares according to the latest s1A filing. Image below is from page 73  formatpn  Of these 135 million shares 124564920 shares are locked for one year from date of consummation of merger. Which was December 7th 2021. So this means these 124 million shares are locked until DECEMBER 7th 2022 or till price stays above 12.50 20 out 30 days. We are still in April and price hasn't met the 20 out of 30 condition either far from it.  formatpn  Quick maths.  135566227124564920 11001307  proofformatpn  Out of the 11 million shares about 9.9 million was owned by three entities. Highbridge Tenor and Glazer.  page 38formatpn  During December BBAI offered these three a forward purchase agreement and gave Highbridge Tenor and Glazer three months to agree. The forward purchase agreement or f.p.a basically said weBBAI can buy your shares for $10.15 if you want to sell them in December BBAI traded for like 78 bucks. You can assume what these 3 entities did.  They all sold by the deadline given. formatpn  latest 10k showing the 3 sold.  Quick maths.  11001307  9952803 1048504  formatpn  So now that we have established the float at 1048504 shares lets get to the fun parts.   SHORT INTEREST  formatpn  YES SHORT INTEREST IS 86.4  of float.   FTD   formatpn  Notice how the FTD's increase as float shrinks.   OPTIONS STATS   8 callsformatpn  April OIformatpn  Let me do something retarded for a sec. You see that open interest on the 15s Well they have a delta of .13. So that means for MM to remain delta neutral they shorted 87 shares for every call right So if say the price goes up from here and these 15s go in the money and the delta for the 15s now is 1 this means MMs have to delta hedge 1300000 shares right And I showed earlier how the float is ONLY 1048504 and short interest is 906000.  SO THIS MEANS PRICE COULD GO PARABOLIC IF MARKET MAKERS ARE DELTA HEDGING AT THE SAME TIME SHORTS ARE TRYING TO COVER.   9 callsformatpn  May OIformatpn  This shit is crazy.   ORTEX   formatpn  Ortex numbers are insane too. Lets break em down.  First let's address the utilization. A high utilization means a crowded short right Meaning a bunch of people are shorting a stock.  But why is utilization so low for BBAI Well check out cost to borrow costs. They go as high as 900. That's SST range and that went as high as 37 dollars this past week. Also a locked float situation  Try as an experiment to short a share of BBAI. You won't be able to find a share to short. The stock is that illiquid. That's why I believe once this goes parabolic it's gonna go go. Cause no one in their right mind is paying 100s of percent trying to borrow shares to short.  formatpn  Found this on twitter formatpn   POSITIONS  130 April 10s  38 April 15s  Special thanks to alilfishy for bringing it to my attention.\n",

Make no mistake. The reason we are at this moment and poised to end the tragic unfair and misguided prohibition on cannabis is because the people got there first. Thirtyeight states have enacted medical marijuana and 18 states have determined that adult use should be legal.

      "On Friday the London Platinum and Palladium Market a major trading venue for Palladium and other platinum group metals banned two major Russian state owned Palladium refineries from having their Palladium and Platinum sold on the LPPM's London and Zurich exchanges This was followed up by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also banning the same Russian state owned refiners today Additionally the Japanese Exchange Group's Osaka exchange is now also reviewing whether or not to ban Russian Palladium and Platinum refiners. This has major implications in the Palladium market as Russia produces about 40 of the world's Palladium. Russia's Palladium and Platinum exports were one of the very last major Russian exports left that were not subject to any major sanctions. As civilian deaths mount in the RussoUkrainian War more and more pressure will mount on Western governments and financial regulators to cut Russia further out of the world markets. Any removal of Russian palladium from the world market gives an excellent opportunity for nonRussian Palladium producers to profit. Aside from Russia major palladium mines are located in South Africa the United States and Canada. Palladium is used heavily in both the car industry and electronics industry being used in both catalytic converters and integrated circuits. If major automakers and chip makers are no longer allowed to buy Russian Palladium they will be all forced to compete for Palladium produced by companies like Sibanye Stillwater SBSW which controls nearly all of American Palladium mining production and has major mines in South Africa and Impala Platinum Holdings JSE IMP which has major Canadian and South African mines.    I am long 400 shares of SBSW.\n",
      "Short Strangle Wheel option strategy idea\n",
      "   tldr  Wheel but you also have 100 shares of the underlying and sell Covered calls along with the Cash secured puts.  So there are many ways to describe this strategy and I don't know if others have already come up with it they probably have but I wanted to know your guys opinion on it and what you think some issues might be. It is essentially a short strangle but you own shares of the underlying and wheel it. So with the usual wheel strategy you sell cash secured puts and generate premium from that and then when assigned sell covered calls above the basis you got assigned on the puts and if its a bullish stock it will eventually pay out. This strategy works similarly except you buy 100 shares of the underlying and sell both OTM calls and OTM puts This way you can profit if the stocks go up or stays even. If you get assigned on your call its above what you bought the shares for so you make profit along with the puts you sold that expire worthless. If the stock stays between the 2 strikes it will act similarly to a iron condor and you just get to keep the premium. If you get assigned on the puts you just buy more shares of the underlying which dollar cost averages your initial shares meaning you can sell more covered calls at a lower basis to breakeven and make profit. Essentially its the wheel but you benefit if the stock stays the same and goes up but if the stock goes down it just DCAs your shares. As long as its a bullish stock and you have enough capital you can just keep dollar cost averaging your way down and the stock would have to rebound a minimal amount for you to still make profit on the shares and you keep all the premium you farmed a long the way from either side. I'm sure there is probably something I have forgotten about or not taken account so please leave your thoughts in the comments.\n",

      "We're Going to GOGO to the Moon  GOGO which is based in Chicago is an inflight internet company that provides broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market.  GOGO is currently working on launching Gogo5G which will deliver 25 Mbps on average with peak speeds in the 7580 Mbps range.  The Why  GOGO is one of the highest shorted stocks with 37.15 of the float sold short. Now you may wonder why this is relevant well it's because GOGO is looking to break through the $20 resistance where it can move up without much technical resistance and it has all the right factors going for it.  The How  GOGO is already up 87 this year and the shorts have been suffering heavily. This is the perfect moment for their positions to collapse. As the shorts will already be looking to derisk in the current market environment it gives the stock an even bigger momentum push.  Speaking about the market GOGO has been going up against it and is green during red days. It's showing what we like to call regard strength.  The Fundamental Technical  1. It was recently added to the  SmallCap 600 Index so the passive investors are all buying. This is supported by the fact that volume has exploded since. 2. Traders are buying in due to momentum and the high short percentage. Supported by the chart and volume as well. 3. It's currently testing levels not seen since 2015.  The Hypothesis  In my opinion $40 is easily achievable in the short term under the current dynamics and the fundamentalstechnicals. The chart looks like it is ready for a parabolic move.  The Position  GOGO 5202022 $20.00 CALL. Still cheap due to low IV and gives me a month for the breakout to occur. Any positive market day could cause it. it's also pumping today during a fear day which is a great sign.

      "Listen up apes I got a play for you. Get out your crayons and take notes.  The stock I am going to introduce you to is CNHI. Many of you may know it as a boring tractor company. But step aside Ryan Cohen a new big daddy CEO is in town.  Scott Wine took over as CEO in January of last year and has already placed an Insider Buy for over 3 million worth of stock. He has split up CNHI so that they focus more purely on agriculture now making them a more agile company.  The most exciting part for me is that they just acquired Raven Industries for a bit over $2 billion. This makes them a contender in the high growth high profit margin industry that is autonomous driving tractors and other high tech ag equipment. They are becoming Deere but without the lawsuits or overpriced stock. To double down on this investment they announced 18 days ago that they are going to be building an advanced engineering center in Nevada USA in order to further propel their high tech farming advancements as well as attract talent to come work for them.  Scott Wine is the former CEO of Polaris and he absolutely transformed that company and exploded the stock. Just look I got my crayons out for you guys. The red circle is when Scott Wine took over in 2008. He took Polaris and made it into a global company imagine what he can do to CNHI.     To be honest I am getting tired of doing DD If you can even call this that so I'll make this even briefer than I had planned and just spit some other factors that I am bullish about real quick. Ill also tag on some pictures.  CNHI is cheap compared to peers 11.74 pe such as Deere 23.19 and CAT 18.35 and even shitty Kubota 13.7 is more expensive  CNHI beats all recent earnings calls like crazy  Q1 2021 beat EPS by 128  Q2 2021  beat EPS by 57.46  Q3 2021  beat eps by 70.62  Q4 2021  beat eps by 19.48   Revenue were also all positives but I'm too lazy to type those all out look it up yourself.  Coincidently I saw a big ass Case tractor on the way home today and boy did it look sexy. I think this is a sign to buy.  Also this nice little picture shows you how it just bounced off the support line and is about to go up to the MOON     Also go to raven industries site  Raven Industries  Raven Industries  you will be impressed. CNHI is doing just as much cool stuff as Deere but it's not priced in yet. We are on the verge of an agriculture revolution and CNHI is poised to take the main stage.  Positions I lost most of my fun money gambling on HMHC sad face so I have to play it safer on this one since I cant afford to lose my savings. If you guys give me more DD and conformation bias then screw it Ill get more options. Currently I hold 110 shares 1 520 $15 call 1 617 $15 call.  If I had money to blow I'd buy the shit out of May or June $17.5 calls. Earnings will be May 3 and I expect it to move fast after another earning beats.

See previous DD  Most technical analysis techniques look at historical prices to divine future prices. This technical analysis focuses instead on the current Option Open Interest. In other words my crayons taste different.  Whenever the stock price blue touches the delta neutral line green and crosses back up it tends to go another 58.  I developed a tool which uses the entire open interest to calculate three important numbers  Delta Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option delta is 0.  Gamma Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is 0.  Gamma Maximum  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is the maximum.  The theory behind it is simple enough institutions tend to be the largest holders of short options contracts and are therefore obligated to hedge against those options contracts while collecting juicy premium riskfree.  By calculating similar numbers to what these institutions are dependent on I'm hoping to ride their coattails and earn tendies from their rounding errors.

      " If You Had To Point Out The Flaws Of The Stock Market Relative To Other Asset Classes What Would They Be  Theres a long list of them high volatility sequence of return risk low cashflow high efficiency and liquidity this could be a pro or con depending on how you look at it lack of significant leverage etc.  Out of all those things however were gonna focus on two of them. The lack of cashflow and the lack of leverage. Both of these things are abundant in real estate in particular. A good rental multifamily can be expected to have a cap rate of 712 with a cash on cash return ideally around 15 or higher. This is because 1 real estate does not rely upon appreciation solely it relies upon the income it generates from the renters and 2 investment properties typically only need a 20 down payment in order to purchase.  Thats a 51 leverage ratio which would be impossible to achieve safely in the stock market.  Now it used to be that stocks had lower appreciation and higher dividend yields however that has not been the case for 70 years at least.  You can take a look at this dividend yield chart of the  500 for reference.  formatpn   Luckily We Can Turn The Stock Market Back Into An Income Machine Using Options  This is the whole premise of the thetagang position. We replace our stock appreciation with premiums received from selling options as a sort of dividend yield.  So we turn to selling puts and calls on SPX or SPY or whatever index you prefer. Thats great but if we compare it back to real estate were still missing the essential component of leverage.  Thats where leveraged ETFs come in.  The pros and cons of LEFTs have been hotly debated but what settled it for me personally was this post by hedgefundie and this article about volatility decay If you don't want to read through all of that I've condensed down the important stuff regarding volatility decay and proper diversification in this posts__mediumweb. But basically assuming it works perhaps we can change it from capital appreciation to income generation using options.  Surely that should work right  Well it should if we do it correctly to avoid assignment as much as possible.  Leveraged ETFs suffer from something called volatility decay basically just describing the idea that a when a loss is incurred a greater gain needs to be made to square ourselves back to zero. With leverage we magnify our risk to this factor.  So because we have more vulnerability to downside lets protect ourselves using a bit of probability.   Using Standard Deviation To Calculate Probabilities  Lets just assume for the moment that all market movements are as good as being random. Yes they are based on data but if we dont have access to said data the movements may as well be random.  Under this assumption we can then also assume that there are probabilities to which direction a stock is going to move. There should be roughly a 50 chance that the stock will go up or down at any given moment.  On top of that we could also assume that larger movements are less likely than smaller movements mainly due to the fact that it takes much larger sudden inflows and outflows of cash to make a stock behave that way. Now some stocks have a relatively higher ability to make a significant move in either direction but even these stocks still have boundaries where they will be unlikely to move.  A good example of this how wild Teslas swings are relative to General Electric. Tesla has a higher relative swing compared to General Electric but even Tesla is unlikely to swing to $30 or $5000 in the next year.  Now these observations we just made are the fundamental ideas behind the concept of standard deviation.  Standard deviation essentially says that within a given time frame usually a year a stock has a certain probability of being within certain price ranges based on its volatility its ability to make wild swings like Tesla.  formatpn  As you can see at the bottom of the chart we see that at each increasing or decreasing standard deviation 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 etc there is less of a probability that our data or in this case the stock price will fall into this range given a normal distribution.  If you add up all the percentages between 1 and 1 we get a 68.2 chance that our stock price will fall in this range. This is called the first standard deviation. If we expand out the 2 and 2 then we get a 95.4 chance that our stock price will fall within the range. That is called the second standard deviation. If we go out to the 3 on each side we get a 98.8 chance that the stock price will fall within the range. With each standard deviation the chance that a stock price will fall within the range gets higher albeit at a much slower rate.   So What Does This Have To Do With Selling Options  Using these standard deviations we can get probabilities that a stock will fall within a certain range. If we use something called Implied Volatility we can figure out what the market thinks that one standard deviation is. Then using that we can predict what probability our option has of expiring in the money which is what we dont want.  To find implied volatility we can go to a website like volafy.net and get the implied volatility percentage. In the case of TQQQ QQQ leveraged 3x the implied volatility is 80 at this time of writing.  Using this percentage we can plug it into a handy formula to calculate the standard deviation for any specific option.  The formula looks like this  sqrtoption days until expiration365  implied volatility  current stock price  In written terms basically we divide the days until expiration by 365 then take the square root of that and multiply it by the implied volatility percentage and the current stock price.  That gives us the amount in dollars of the first standard deviation. If you take that amount and add it AND subtract it from the current price it will give you the range the stock will fall within 68 of the time.  Right now we are interested in selling puts on TQQQ without getting exercised so well sell at one standard deviation out of the money. At the current price of TQQQ $51.84 the first standard deviation out of the money would be $38.11 which is also 51.84  13.73.  If we go back up to our standard deviation chart we can see that on the left side of the chart the side that represents our OTM options we can add up all the percentages before the 1st standard deviation mark. This comes out to be a 15.9 that our OTM option will become ITM by expiration you might have noticed that this percentage closely correlates with the delta of the option which is a good way to gauge it as well. If we are selling monthly options this comes out to be getting assigned once out of every six months on average. To me those seem like pretty good odds.  So lets go down to the $38 strike put on TQQQ which is trading $128 per contract right now. Thats a 3.37 ROI in 40 days or 30.75 annually.  If we assume assignment three times a year that wipes out any premiums made for that given month we are still sitting on a 20.64 CAGR.   But Wait Isnt This Riskier Than Selling Puts On Regular Old QQQ  This is the beauty of it you have the same risk of getting assigned on TQQQ as you do with QQQ if you stay at the same standard deviation but still receive 3x the premium. This is because with TQQQ higher volatility we sell further OTM than we would with regular QQQ but still receive the high premiums due to it being a leveraged product.  If you do happen to get assigned no worries Personally I would recommend that you simply just sell out of the position at the current price and open a new put for the next month. The reason why I say this as opposed to selling a call is that calls do not have the same volatility risk premium that puts do and therefore do not sell for as much. If you want to read more there is this paperreprep which discusses the outperformance of a put writing only strategy that outperforms during bearflat markets. If you open a new put you are simply taking the loss for that month with the intention that the high win rate probability of this trading strategy will make you square again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS STRATEGY ON ANYTHING BESIDES INDEXES if you do chances are that eventually that stock will get wiped out and never recover I'm looking at you TLRY. Indexes on the other hand do recover you don't need to look any further than this chart to prove it.   500 Returnsformatpn  TLDR Sell puts on TQQQ way OTM instead of buying them. Leverage make put selling go BRRR.\n",

Everything was in the red so it was pretty realistic and I started scrolling down my portfollio showing him some of the stocks I own.  I then got to NOK. And as we looked at it it went up to $20. I said that's unusual for a stock to go up that much in just a short time and no sooner had the words left my mouth did it go to $40. And then I got interested and it went to $80. So I was buying like a fucking t on chips and it went all the way to $254. Stayed around the $250 mark for a couple of minutes and then went back down to about $116 before eventually going all the way back to the start I obviously did not sell in time.  Anyway.

I was thinking about this and noticed how there is hundreds of ways the week could play out  that would result in SPY going down.    I am still going to continue the 5 Day Outlook because it is something funny to do just take it with a grain of salt because it is seriously impossible to predict every single day before the futures market even opens... I write these Saturday morning.     1 Day Chartformatpn  The main levels have been the same for about a month now  Support 432  Resistance 452  The RSI is showing the K approaching an oversold reading there will at least be a short term relief in the selling pressure overall  1 Day Chartformatpn  I would classify the bollinger band with as a somewhat mean reverting indicator to get a sense of the overall volatility.  Since the bollinger bands have a relative wide span we can assume that we will likely be entering a phase of lower volatility.     CPI Data Release Dateformatpn  Everyone is going to be watching the CPI data when it is released on Tuesday.  Remember that Ukraine was invaded February 24th so all of the effects on the global markets were felt last month in March.    All retail investors will be watching and all of Wall Street will be watching.  This is not going to be pretty...  FAO Food Price Indexformatpn  Food prices have gotten to absurd levels this shows how bad inflation has affected everyone.   10 Year Government Bond Yieldsformatpn  I saw this chart floating around that shows a historical trend line of the major economic recessions in the United States and how they correlate to to the 10Y yield.     30 Year Bond Yield Compared to SPXformatpn  I was looking around and can conclude that the 30 Year bond Yields have more variation but are a better indicator for timing the end of an economic cycle.  There is nothing to be done now I am just waiting.  I still have a lot of positions open when this crash starts I will start to liquidate everything... believe me it will be very noticeable when it starts.    Federal Reserve FOMC statementformatpn  Bullard is concerned for the economy and wants at least a 50 to 75bp rate hike.  I actually found this kind of interesting because he is one of the least corrupt people in office.  He has a net worth around 5 million which is surprisingly low for having inside information.  He also has never worked with big banks and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.  He definitely knows what is going on and what needs to be done to save the economy.  The federal reserve will eventually have to become more aggressive in rate hikes.   Crude Oil CFDsformatpn  Predictions  Tuesday is going to be an extremely important day.  I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10.  Oil rose 35 in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5 which is going to shock the markets.    Another factor is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.    The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.  I hate to be that person but over the last year with unemployment decreasing spending increasing and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80 without interfering.  At most there will be a 50 bear market similar to 2008.  The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell then it should recover in the following days.

      "Gapped up and gapped down stocks  good strategy potential\n",
      " Does anyone here currently use after market gap analysis to identify stock likely to shift dramatically on market next day open  Here's the basics   Gapping occurs when the price of a stock or another asset opens above or below the previous day's close with no trading activity in between. A gap is the area discontinuity in a security's price chart. Gaps may materialize when headlines cause market fundamentals to change rapidly during hours when markets are typically closed for instance the result of an earnings call afterhours.  Gapping may also refer to the difference or spread in rates at which banks borrow and lend. The dynamic gap measures how assets money held and liabilities money loaned change over time.  Here's a good example from last week  HP Inc NYSE HPQ stock price gapped up 18.6 after Warren Buffett revealed that Berkshire Hathaway had acquired 121 million shares.  This lead to this early jump in price   formatpn     You can use sites such as barchart.com to run gap up and gap down stock analysis to identify potential targets for profits out of the gates on markets open.  More often that not a gapup will encourage a 'buy' and gapdown will encourage a 'sell'.  However you need to gauge the momentum behind the stock and trend to decide what is the appropriate strategy to deploy however as a simple start point gap circumstances can roughly be categorised as such  1. A breakaway gap Sell short and place a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. 2. An exhaustion gap  prices pull back into it the next day The downtrend is over Cover shorts immediately. 3. Another exhaustion gap marked by a lack of new highs after the gap Several days of churning offer good shorting opportunities with a stop above the high. 4. A continuation gap in a downtrend Go short with a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. Prices hit that stop a few days later  no method is failsafe. 5. An exhaustion gap closed two days after it opened Cover shorts immediately. 6. A common gap in the midst of a congestion area closed the next day No action recommended. 7. A breakaway gap Go long and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. 8. A continuation gap Add to longs and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. The gap at the right edge of the chart could be either a continuation or an exhaustion gap. Relatively quiet volume suggests continuation. If you buy place a protective stop a few ticks below the lower rim of this gap.  In the HP example above this was a breakaway gap with sufficient indicator and fundamental analysis to tell you this was a 'BUY'.  In any case a good solid strategy to nail down and add to the arsenal.\n",

      "So I've done some work for the poultry industry in the past.  Because of the bird flu scare they wanted to unload a ton of eggs quickly at cut rate costs.  They reached out to me because they know I am on WSB and do some day trading.  I saw this opportunity and agreed to sell some futures contracts.  I ended up selling the agreed upon allotment of DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures.  Turns out I probably could have sold those contracts for way more than I did but we farmers and I wanted to make sure the eggs would move before they went bad.  I only took a 5 cut and the rest goes to the farmers so every contract sold did ok.  If we held out a little longer we could've cleared at least another 20 or more.  Needless to say the farmers have had to massacre their chicken stocks because of the bird flu.  So this one guy that we sold some contracts to wanted more.  Despite being over capacity the farmers wanted to sell more to make up for the fact they were making less per egg.  The farmers coop accepted his contract offers and we'd make more eggs.  This meant all of us myself the farmers and their kids etc. would have to put in the OT to make sure we filled this order.       Now the buyer of the contracts is saying he was messed up when he bought the contracts and cant take physical delivery of the final 10 contracts because of the size of his storage location.  A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs.  A tonne of eggs is anywhere between 1086 and 1736 dozens of eggs.  In total we are talking about over 1 million eggs.  How do you buy a contract and not know that you do not have appropriate storage let alone 10 contracts  Also for reference a chicken will lay one egg per day if youre lucky.  To fill this over sized order we were sitting there jacking off roosters for a week straight to get all of the chicken jizz and then had to finger every hen to knock them up to get the eggs made.  If you turn on a black light in my place you'd go blind and I have a few roosters following me around and sending me chocolates and flowers.     What should I do  I need this guy to take the damn eggs.\n",

Gamma Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is 0.  Gamma Maximum  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is the maximum.  The theory behind it is simple enough institutions tend to be the largest holders of short options contracts and are therefore obligated to hedge against those options contracts while collecting juicy premium riskfree.  By calculating similar numbers to what these institutions are dependent on I'm hoping to ride their coattails and earn tendies from their rounding errors.

      "I know there will be lots of just short the housing market bro responses but I am more interested in the opinions of the OG WSB autists if you guys are still around. Full disclosure I'm not involved in this market.   Papa powell lowered fed rates to almost 0 during the beer virus and printed paper so there were lots of easy money. This money first went into stonks and the market became too hot. Institutional investors had to find an alternative asset class and it seemed like they went into real estate.   As you have noticed the housing market went crazy over the last few years. However I also noticed this insane price hike is mostly for starter homes  aka the houses for entrylevel buyers getting their first home. These starters are singlefamily housesapartmentsduplexescondostownhouses you get the idea. In contrast my older wealthy friends' gt$1M mansion had seen maybe 300k increase while the starter houses my younger friends are looking to buy increased by x2 or x3.   Investors instead of home buyers purchased gt18 of all real estate sold in Q3 2021 alone Firms like BlackRock has bought 66 apartment complexes in my city  not units entire complexes. I also looked at the prospectus of two REITs Vanguard VNQ and BlackRock USRT and residential is the secondhighest holding in these funds. The top holding is something called Specialized REIT  I wonder if apartment complexes or residential RE holding companies count as such. In both funds' documents they identified increasing interest rates as a significant risk factor. The point is this is just two REITs. There are lots more of these institutional or even individual investors of various sizes buying up starter homes.    With all that said I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on where this is going and how it will end. The following is my speculation and thinkingoutloud so probably not everything makes sense   It seems to me like these institutions are cornering the market by controlling the supply and causing the price to increase and then slowly selling these starter houses to any sucker who would be willing to pay the ridiculous price ... so are they holding a bunch of empty houses waiting for appreciation or are they also renting them out How are the occupy rates   Switching gears  what about the packaging and reselling of these mortgages Anything going on there I know they never stopped selling CDOs after 0809. Like the film ending scene of 'the Big Short' pointed out they are now making 'boutique synthetic CDOs'  and call them 'bespoke tranche opportunity' and there's a lot of activity in product   As interest rates start to increase are institutions gonna fire sale and try to make their rival firms and new home buyers hold the bag I'm not sure of the exact cause or mechanism but if they needed to cooperate and hold it all together they wouldn't  just look at how they handled Bill Hwang's swaps. They all agreed to slowly unwind but right after the meeting when Credit Susse and UBS went to sleep Goldman and Morgan immediate offloaded and tanked those stonks and market in general. That's relatively small in comparison to the entire housing market.   Anyway I would love to hear your opinions thoughts and insights on this. Thanks for reading my rant.\n",

      "China binds Russian business. Entrepreneurs are switching to the yuan\n",
      "As stated by money.pl   gt Sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine are pushing Russia into the orbit of Chinese influence.  Economic cooperation is tightening but Beijing plays a dominant role in this arrangement.  Dreams of a big ruble are falling aside.  Russian business is already switching to yuan billing and the Chinese are buying Russian oil and coal for their currency  gt Although Vladimir Putin dreamed of a petrublel and settlements with the West in the Russian currency the economic reality reveals this dream.  It is not the ruble but the yuan that has a much greater influence in the region and with each day of sanctions China's position will strengthen drawing Russia into an orbit of dependence and influence.  gt Russian banks have already recorded a sharp increase in the number of accounts in yuan writes Rzeczpospolita and explains that the transition to the yuan has become necessary for Russian business because of the sanctions.  gt This tendency is confirmed by a poll of the Kommersant newspaper quoted by Rzeczpospolita.  Since the beginning of the year the amount of funds in accounts in Chinese currency has increased approximately eightfold at Tinkoff Bank and fourfold at MTS Bank and Uralski Bank for Reconstruction and Development UBRD.  The same is happening at the St. Petersburg Bank where the number of these business accounts has almost 3.5fold and the number of contracts in Chinese currency has doubled.  gt Russian entrepreneurs are forced to trade in yuan.  The domestic currency is unstable and Western sanctions and Putin's decrees such as the one of March 5 prohibiting the repayment of liabilities to entities from the list of hostile countries in Western currencies make it difficult for entrepreneurs to do business with contractors abroad.  gt   China also has ambitions  at least in Asia  to dominate trade in its currency.  If you add to this the fact that the sanctions throw Moscow into the arms of Beijing's dependence the yuan will rather have a dominant role  confirmed in an interview with money.pl prof.  Dariusz Filar.  gt As Rzeczpospolita points out more Russian companies are betting on the yuan.  Among them are companies trading in spare parts textiles and food products.  The oil steel and mining industries are also starting to deal in Chinese currency.  According to the daily private Chinese companies are buying oil and coal from Russia for delivery in May and June.  gt Russia is falling more and more into the orbit of Chinese interests.  As we wrote in money.pl China is Russia's largest trading partner and although bilateral trade reached a new record of $ 147 billion last year these relations are very asymmetrical.  gt The strategic partnership between Russia and China brings more benefits to the Middle Kingdom than to Russia.  Russia is only the 15th export partner of the PRC.  In addition China has overtaken Russia in terms of trade with most Central Asian countries.  gt The situation is similar in the energy sector especially in the gas sector.  In 2014 after Russia's military intervention in Crimea when Russia received further economic sanctions from the European Union and was isolated in the West China after ten long years of negotiations suddenly decided to conclude a gas contract with it forcing the Kremlin to accept a low  delivery prices.

While I dont have positions yet I dont hate $FB or $PYPL here.    1. Plains All American Pipeline NASDAQPAA  PAA's strength lies in its welllocated midstream energy infrastructure in the lowestcost U.S. shale basin Permian Basin. In fact it has such substantial scale and strategic positioning in the Permian Basin that Morningstar speculates that  It's not much of a stretch to state that there is a high probability that in some fashion Plains touches every barrel of oil the Permian produces earning a fee if not multiple fees.  While weakness in volumes from the basin relative to supply of infrastructure has led to poor financial results for PAA in recent years demand is beginning to recover in the basin and we expect PAA to be a big beneficiary of this trend.   Wall Street analysts seems to agree with consensus estimates for distributable cash per unit expected to improve at a 7.9 CAGR over the next half decade despite growth capital expenditures set to decline to a mere $275 million in 2022 down from $950 million in 2020.  Management is allocating the extra free cash flow primarily towards paying down debt in an effort to further strengthen its investment grade standing and set the business up to better weather any future downcycles like it experienced in 2020.  Additionally PAA has been allocating free cash flow towards equity unit repurchases  accelerating its buyback pace in Q4  and is also growing its distribution at a brisk pace just hiked its quarterly distribution by 20.8 in an effort to restore it to its precut level.   With an expected 2022 free cash flow level of $1.3 billion PAA currently offers a mouthwatering 16.5 free cash flow yield that covers its recently increased distribution by more than two times.   This  when combined with expectations of strong perunit distributable cash flow growth over the next half decade  will enable PAA to deleverage grow its distribution and buy back units at a very solid clip and should lead to outsized total returns for unitholders. \n",

      "Listen up apes I got a play for you. Get out your crayons and take notes.  The stock I am going to introduce you to is CNHI. Many of you may know it as a boring tractor company. But step aside Ryan Cohen a new big daddy CEO is in town.  Scott Wine took over as CEO in January of last year and has already placed an Insider Buy for over 3 million worth of stock. He has split up CNHI so that they focus more purely on agriculture now making them a more agile company.  The most exciting part for me is that they just acquired Raven Industries for a bit over $2 billion. This makes them a contender in the high growth high profit margin industry that is autonomous driving tractors and other high tech ag equipment. They are becoming Deere but without the lawsuits or overpriced stock. To double down on this investment they announced 18 days ago that they are going to be building an advanced engineering center in Nevada USA in order to further propel their high tech farming advancements as well as attract talent to come work for them.  Scott Wine is the former CEO of Polaris and he absolutely transformed that company and exploded the stock. Just look I got my crayons out for you guys. The red circle is when Scott Wine took over in 2008. He took Polaris and made it into a global company imagine what he can do to CNHI.     To be honest I am getting tired of doing DD If you can even call this that so I'll make this even briefer than I had planned and just spit some other factors that I am bullish about real quick. Ill also tag on some pictures.  CNHI is cheap compared to peers 11.74 pe such as Deere 23.19 and CAT 18.35 and even shitty Kubota 13.7 is more expensive  CNHI beats all recent earnings calls like crazy  Q1 2021 beat EPS by 128  Q2 2021  beat EPS by 57.46  Q3 2021  beat eps by 70.62  Q4 2021  beat eps by 19.48   Revenue were also all positives but I'm too lazy to type those all out look it up yourself.  Coincidently I saw a big ass Case tractor on the way home today and boy did it look sexy. I think this is a sign to buy.  Also this nice little picture shows you how it just bounced off the support line and is about to go up to the MOON     Also go to raven industries site  Raven Industries  Raven Industries  you will be impressed. CNHI is doing just as much cool stuff as Deere but it's not priced in yet. We are on the verge of an agriculture revolution and CNHI is poised to take the main stage.  Positions I lost most of my fun money gambling on HMHC sad face so I have to play it safer on this one since I cant afford to lose my savings. If you guys give me more DD and conformation bias then screw it Ill get more options. Currently I hold 110 shares 1 520 $15 call 1 617 $15 call.  If I had money to blow I'd buy the shit out of May or June $17.5 calls. Earnings will be May 3 and I expect it to move fast after another earning beats.  This is not financial advice I am probably more smoothed brained than most of you. This is a company that's in the same industry that I work in and I have a good feeling about it.\n",

      "Uranium neuron firing edition\n",
      "U.UN  for the smooth brains now fuck off before your singular neuron start firing.  I'm at work forced to lay off the sugar so let's try to write something for the one guy whose IQ looped around 0. The guy who is rich as fuck but still get no bitches because he invests like a boomer.  Disclaimer a lot of the information here are second hand from people who are popular but some of the information aren't easily verifiable.  The base thesis  We have a demandsupply deficit. 200m pounds of annual demand 135m pounds of annual primary supply from the ground for a 65m pound annual deficit. These numbers are from UxC which is a major nuclear fuel consulting business. You can definitely model the numbers based on the number of operational reactors and respective output of each operating mine.    formatpn  There is an unknown amount of secondary supply out there due to Japan's sudden halt of nuclear energy post Fukushima and the sale of the previously stockpiled nuclear fuels. There are also existing inventories as well as the concept of reverse carry trades. The important thing is that secondary supplies are limited they are good for one use and that's it.  When you use more than you receive you will face a shortage. A simple matter of when not if.  On the other side you have the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust SPUT. A simple investing concept where you give them money and they buy uranium U3O8 and store it. From 19 July 2021 they have purchased 36m pounds of uranium. This figure is not included in the 200m pound demand.  The NAV of the trust is a measly 3.5B which really isn't much in the investing world.  Prices have to go higher  Higher prices means more production it's that simple.   formatpn  The important thing to look at is the production cost indicator PCI. Current spot prices are $63.50lb vs the $52.00lb PCI.  I started investing in uranium last September. Back then the spot price was $40lb. Indeed the risk has increased but I'm not too worried as inflation is here to stay and miners will like demand higher prices to account for the inflation risk in the next 35 years as they built their mines.  Mines will run out  Once uranium gets mined out of the ground it's no longer in the ground.  formatpn  Prices have to get high to incentivize existing mines to restart and even higher to incentivize exploration.  Similarly you can model these as a lot of the publicly traded companies will report the expected remaining life time of their mines.  Increasing demand  A lot of countries are building new reactors. Here are some of the big ones.  EU was having some luck with France leading the nuclear push in the EU taxonomy but things seemed to have quieten down.  Japan the real OG are planning to turn nuclear plants back on due to rising energy prices and also RUSSIAN ENERGY GO FUCK YOURSELF.    China has plans to build another 150 nuclear power plants by 2035. Previously I wrote a DD about the political genius of pivoting to nuclear energy as there is supply that are China friendly.   Kazakhstan produces about 40 of the world's supply of the base form of U3O8.  Russia is 13 of the world's capacity of converting U3O8 to UF6.  Russia is 40 of the world's enrichment capacity.    China is heavily pushing for electrifying of vehicles and a massive nuclear build out because they understand that reliance on oil means getting held by the balls by the US controlled middle east and that they can be easily blockaded. Going nuclear means energy security and we all know China will get something done when they want it to get done.    Russian Sanctions  Russia fucked Ukraine so now America and Europe decides to sanction Russian nuclear. Remember how Russia is 40 of the world's enrichment capacity  Turns out the enrichment process determines how effectively you can use the based U3O8. More enrichment means less U3O8 used underfeeding and vice versa overfeeding.    You can already see the effect of the ban through the nuclear supply chain.    formatpn  Sprott Inc  Sprott Inc is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing.  Two important products are the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust SPUT and the recently acquired North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF.  SPUT NAV has grown from 600M to 3.5B since 19 July 2021 till now.  Below is North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF's NAV prior to acquisition by Sprott.      Dated 7 April 2022formatpn  Important thing is that Sprott is a heavyweight and knows how to raise money for their products.  With both the physical trust and the ETF under their control it's time for them to really  up capital acquisition.  Within a week of URNM's acquisition Sprott filed the application for SPUT to be listed on the NYSE.    How to play this  The common narrative is that miners are a leveraged play on uranium spot prices.  Assuming miner has an operating cost of $30lb a movement of spot prices from $40 to $60 would mean...  50 increase in spot prices and 200 increase in miner earnings.  It's a correct line of thought but the issue comes in that a lot of these miners are 35 years from production. During this time they will face inflation risk and ballooning capex costs. If they require further financing they face taking on debt at less attractive rates or share issuance which will result in dilution.  Next the miners price in what they expect prices to hold at. Just because spot price hits $200lb for 2 seconds and you managed to get one off in that time doesn't mean that miners will price in $200lb. The price has to hold for a significant time OR long term contracts have to be signed at those prices.  Lastly a liquidity crunch from QT and a prolonged bear market might result in suppressed stock prices but reactors will continue running and there will still be demand for the uranium metal propping prices up.  The two major producing companies Cameco and Kazatomprom both have their own issues.  Cameco runs the risk of a cash flow crunch if spot prices spike before they are able to  up production.   httpsimgur.comauuqzayA formatpn  Kazatomprom is in Kazakhstan and they had a riot in January due to rising oil prices and income inequality. Guess what food prices are rising and that typically comes with FREE SOCIAL INSTABILITY.   TLDR  The uranium thesis is the only other thing that gets me hard but many miners are going to be negative cashflow for the next 35 years facing potential dilution expensive debt and even bankruptcy.  Hence the risk to reward seems better on physical uranium.  Maybe it's because I laid off sugar for the past two days to type this out but the phrase risk management just popped up next to OH SHIT TO THE MOON in my dictionary.

      "Desktop Metal  The Next Industrial Revolution Continued Apr. 22\n",
      "Following on from my last DDutm_mediumios_ap_nameiossmf shared here on NYSEDM I thought Id share an update as to why I believe this has high potential for a significant shortterm move as well as exponential longterm returns.   Despite the heavy decline in share price postmerger due to dilution and marketwide downward pressure on SPACssmall capsspeculative stocks Desktop Metal remains a highly appealing company  particularly at current valuations.   WHAT DO THEY DO AGAIN  To reiterate my last post Desktop Metal operate in additive manufacturing i.e. 3D printing in almost every area you can imagine and the companys technology is protected by over 300 patents with further pending. The company itself originated from the 3D printing of metal products and their machines are designed to be faster smaller cheaper safer and without needing a trained operator.  However the company has also made and continues to make highprofile acquisitions to further diversify and expand their consumer base. In doing so they have also eliminated essentially all of their competition and gained significant IP and propriety technology security. The company is arguably the industry leader in applications as diverse as fluid power systems metallurgy ceramics and polymers all the way to wood products and biofabrication under its Forust and Desktop Health brands respectively.   The sheer technical ability they now possess is simply mind blowing and scope of this technology is literally infinite. Prototyping becomes quick and cheap supply chain issues can be significantly reduced if not eliminated and the means of manufacturing needs no dependence on location for the exploitation of labor restrictions and costs nor the existence of borders as designs are digital. In addition to this the company manages and operates its own supply chain in over 65 countries.    WHAT HAS CHANGED  Since my last post the company has progressed with strength towards its growth targets and profitability. Desktop Metal and its subsidiaries boast an extensive list of bestinclass customers without disproportionate reliance on any single revenue stream.   Desktop Health launched the Einstein printer along with Flexcera resins perhaps the most accurate dental 3D printer to date and boasting FDA clearance for permanent use. Furthermore this transforms the process of creating dentures and other cosmetics to mere minutes and with perfect accuracy.  The company also welcomed the XSeries line of systems gained by the acquisition of their main competition ExOne in 2021. This system was also adopted immediately by the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation for use in advanced nuclear energy solutions.  Kimura Foundry Group puchased a 10th system stating that In the first five years after investing in its first ExOne sand binder jetting machines in 2013 Kimuras revenue increased more than 500 percent as a result of the speed and design freedom the new system provided to end customers  demonstrating the impact and desirability that Desktop Metals systems will have on manufacturers and designers along with cementing their repeat business from recurring revenue streams such as maintenance materials and repeat sales.  The company also launched its longawaited revolutionary P50 system after tripling its production capacity with Stanley Black Decker as the systems first notable customer of more than eighty in line. Shapeways also committed to more Desktop Metal systems in turn boosting the value of Desktop Metals stake in Shapeways.  CEO Rick Fulop also recently purchased over half a million dollars of DM stock. Fulop is noted as being distinctly protective of the companys future explaining the aggression of the acquisitions made using SPAC and dilution funds. Further to this Fulop has repeatedly stated there is zero chance of a hostile takeover. As such the company recently filed an ASR stating The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved Class A common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest tender offer merger or otherwise.    FINANCIALS  In the most recent earnings report the company outlined a 123 growth in revenue in the last quarter and up 62 excluding revenue captured by the acquisition of ExOne. They also demonstrated expanding margins for the sixth consecutive quarter. Furthermore total revenue was up 583 from the previous year. The company is guiding for $260M revenue for the current year up 131 from the last annual report. As of December 31st the company has $272.7M in cash and equivalents a large enough runway to reach profitability within five years.    STOCK  The companys stock has spent so far spent 2022 consolidating and is currently looking to settle into its $4.405.20 range after it broke out in midMarch placing it at a $1.387B market cap as of the latest close. This also places it precisely at a key area of demand and support and as such I expect a bounce to retest the resistance at $5.20.   The stock has been met with significant resistance at $5.20 but a close above this can signal a further breakout to fill the gap between $7.19 and $8.01  the average analyst price estimate and a 50 near term move. Such a move would bring the higher range of analyst targets into range breaking into the low teens.   Assuming that the company continues to execute on their planned trajectory and captures even just their small target percentage of the additive manufacturing market the stock is easily worth well into the hundreds within the next five years. Just a 5 market capture places fair value at $130share and I firmly believe that given the barrier to entry that DM have created via acquisitions IP expertise and technology they could capture upwards of 33  working out at about $830 as a long term price target as a minimum. There is simply no area they cannot penetrate with the same aggression execution and profitability as Amazon and I would not be surprised to see this as the biggest growth story of the next decade.      So let me know what you think Im currently holding 5000 shares and accumulating until profitability and likely beyond. The market cap is finding a floor at the companys core value so any move lower is entirely unreasonable and unsustainable in my opinion.\n",

      "$SPY  Predictions for the week of 411\n",
      "Last week I said that SPY was going to slope down with nothing crazy that happened except my 5 day forecast got inversed.  The days that I thought would be bearish were actually bullish.    I was thinking about this and noticed how there is hundreds of ways the week could play out  that would result in SPY going down.    I am still going to continue the 5 Day Outlook because it is something funny to do just take it with a grain of salt because it is seriously impossible to predict every single day before the futures market even opens... I write these Saturday morning.     1 Day Chartformatpn  The main levels have been the same for about a month now  Support 432  Resistance 452  The RSI is showing the K approaching an oversold reading there will at least be a short term relief in the selling pressure overall  1 Day Chartformatpn  I would classify the bollinger band with as a somewhat mean reverting indicator to get a sense of the overall volatility.  Since the bollinger bands have a relative wide span we can assume that we will likely be entering a phase of lower volatility.     CPI Data Release Dateformatpn  Everyone is going to be watching the CPI data when it is released on Tuesday.  Remember that Ukraine was invaded February 24th so all of the effects on the global markets were felt last month in March.    All retail investors will be watching and all of Wall Street will be watching.  This is not going to be pretty...  FAO Food Price Indexformatpn  Food prices have gotten to absurd levels this shows how bad inflation has affected everyone.   10 Year Government Bond Yieldsformatpn  I saw this chart floating around that shows a historical trend line of the major economic recessions in the United States and how they correlate to to the 10Y yield.     30 Year Bond Yield Compared to SPXformatpn  I was looking around and can conclude that the 30 Year bond Yields have more variation but are a better indicator for timing the end of an economic cycle.  There is nothing to be done now I am just waiting.  I still have a lot of positions open when this crash starts I will start to liquidate everything... believe me it will be very noticeable when it starts.    Federal Reserve FOMC statementformatpn  Bullard is concerned for the economy and wants at least a 50 to 75bp rate hike.  I actually found this kind of interesting because he is one of the least corrupt people in office.  He has a net worth around 5 million which is surprisingly low for having inside information.  He also has never worked with big banks and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.  He definitely knows what is going on and what needs to be done to save the economy.  The federal reserve will eventually have to become more aggressive in rate hikes.   Crude Oil CFDsformatpn  Predictions  Tuesday is going to be an extremely important day.  I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10.  Oil rose 35 in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5 which is going to shock the markets.    Another factor is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.    The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.  I hate to be that person but over the last year with unemployment decreasing spending increasing and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80 without interfering.  At most there will be a 50 bear market similar to 2008.  The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell then it should recover in the following days.

      "It's almost a multiple issue Burry wrote on Twitter 44.48 2.53 5.38. He also included a chart that tracks pricetoearnings ratios for the  500's equallyweighted index. The chart shows that the ratio was below 1.0 for much of the 1990s and 2000s but has almost doubled in the past decade and is now above 1.9.  Presumably Burry would like to point out that the index is trading at almost twice the revenue of its constituents  suggesting that the valuation multiples of America's largest public companies have reached unsustainable heights.  Goldman Sachs 319.78 0.98 0.31 strategist MacNeil Curry pointed out last week that it's not just the 10year note that's worth noting. Yields on 5year and 2year notes are also fast approaching or testing significant longterm trendlines a breach of which would signal the end of the downtrend since the 1982 yield highs.  Burry is best known for his Big bet on the U.S. housing bubble in the mid2000s popularized in the book and movie 'The Big Short.' He also invested in GameStop before its stock price soared in January 2021 paving the way for the Meme stock boom. Last year he also made highprofile bets on Musk's Tesla 986.95 11.02 1.13 and On Ms. Wood's flagship product the Ark Innovation ETF.  Burry has repeatedly warned over the past 18 months about overvalued assets and predicted a historic selloff. Last June he warned that the market was in the midst of the biggest speculative bubble in history.  But he always emptied his Twitter feed shortly after warning of a stock market crash. This was his first tweet since March.  Bond bulls face 'last Line of defense'  Meanwhile bond bulls are facing their own crisis of faith with some media suggesting that the bulls' last line of defense has now arrived. Carter Worth of CNBC said  A logarithmic move in the 10year US Treasury yield shows that it is testing the most important trend line ever seen in any market.  While 10year Treasury yields rose above 2.80 per cent on Tuesday morning before march's postCPI plunge they need to close above 2.83 per cent to mark a break in trend.\n",
      "I Working You Working WeWorking\n",
      "  I Working You Working WeWorking  Wall Street Oasis   I don't have a position right now nor have I ever had one but it is safe to conclude that WeWork is a solid buy right now. This is a birds' eye view of the company but I doubt the broader thesis here changes.  1. Share price is 51 down since going public in Oct'20 it's currently at $4.84 and since the lowest it can go is obviously 0 downside is reasonably protected as you're buying it at a cheap discount  good value...maybe they have to raise equity again in the very foreseeable future given historical levels of cash burn but the following note was penned taking atleast a 2436 month time view     2. I spent some time at a few different WeWorks the summer of 2018 in Chicago and felt back then that there was a lot they could get away with. For instance serving beer in the office was an unnecessary expense to incur and so were arranging events with the goal of bringing the community together not only in my experience were these events thinly attended but also noise pollution for those who were actually trying to get stuff done. Obviously these are anecdotes that I am relaying here but the broader point here is that in a way the PR crises that WeWork faced has been good for the company and I think they will emerge with a better balance sheet and more streamlined operating model more below  3. WeWork's focus on location  expense rationalization as well as willingness to extract more from landlords net capex for improvements is I think reflected in its improving operating cash flow. If WeWork needs to amendcancel the lease they should have reasonable negotiating leverage with the landlord to not get fucked over because given this ecommerce boom and consequently the need for logistics  warehouse operations to be closer to the endcustomer in order to minimize delivery and waiting times an astute landlord should have options.WeWork's locations based on my limited experience in Chicago 2018 and Toronto 2022 tend to be located in decently quality areas with good enough foot traffic and nearby amenities. Where it does own properties and wants to sell to rationalize there should not be a shortage of buyers.   4. I personally don't like working in shared spaces but I do think that most people do enjoy them and this is a model that is here to stay. Since WeWork has a firstmover advantage is protected by VERY high barriers to entry and its name is synonymous with office share this will bode well for the company. Plus WeWork should be a good alternative for companies looking to rationalize their real estate foot print post this pandemic  epidemic  5. Biggest upsides to the model though are the expected  in the physical occupancy rates and the growing  of Enterprise Members who are less pricesensitive and locked in for a longer tenor. Physical occupancy currently around the 5060 and back in 2018 was around 80. Focus on Enterprise Members is also showing  of members who are enterprise companies with gt 500 employees was 38 and 42 in 2018 and 2019 respectively. It currently is 47 and though less than where it was in Dec 2020 52 pandemic played a role here...  6. Lastly and this is not something that I say lightly that the company already screwed up once in 2019 which led to all kinds of PR crises for its biggest shareholder Softbank and others. They should not screw this again. A lot on the line and so I expect nuts and bolts to tighten as well as bettersound corporate governance to prevail going fwd  At a share price of $4.84 the market is just not factoring these things i.e. not giving them enough credit for their growth prospects. I am not a WeWork scout here and so not trying to act like a telemarketer here but if you're not constraint by investment time horizon this is definitely a buy for the next 23 years if not more.\n",

      "41122 SPY AMD QQQ F Apple VIX Daily TA\n",
      "    The day before CPI the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my 2 red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days.   The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesnt have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema above for bearish and below for bullish.    formatpn  We actually established yet another downward channel today that I dont suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse.    formatpn   formatpn  We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse.   But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I dont really forsee unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10 that we do it but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.   formatpn  The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now.    formatpn  The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20 50 and 100 ema on the daily 445.21 446.55 and 446.63 but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside.   Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 unlimited upside BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I dont suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow.    formatpn  Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema 443.96 445.9. The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 weekly 50.   Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday monthly option expiration.   Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p.   Thursday monthly has 15k 445c 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p 66k 435p 113k 430p.  That is a massive amount of OI to the downside thats expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too.   With the last CPI being 7.5 expected at 7.9 but the consensus at 8.4 its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war gas prices more covid etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow.    formatpn  Apple had a heck of a red day today too mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today. I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not however expect it to happen today. However I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning.   Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here.   Channel support tomorrow is 157 unlimited downside and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However if Apple loses 165.54 daily 100ema we can expect further downside this week.   I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may reenter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.    formatpn  The blood for AMD just continues but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive 5.2 hit which I believe it was down around 6 at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 7274. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right.   I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema tomorrow most likely to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside.    formatpn  Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5 however after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.  Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I dont suspect the RSI to be an issue.   Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position.    formatpn  QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how.   Channel support is 322 unlimited downside and resistance is 342 for tomorrow.   I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20 50 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.    formatpn  The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11 from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels but mind you that was on the downside not the upside.    formatpn  When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI.   Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising 30 year fixed mortgages rising again the inverted treasury yields inflation covid war gas etc. etc. etc. recession etc. etc. etc. talks  up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two.   While some dont think its a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of... took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling thats the pr to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow.   10 challenge  Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19 a spy put for 20 and a call for 20. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70 at open that spiked to 30 around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at 30. I also played a call and put for 25 then 10 during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10 puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal however factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.\n",
      "Inflation Announcement  My Prediction\n",
      "Back a couple months ago I made a post about how inflation is a lot higher than reporting and that inflation reporting is time delayed.  Well today is that day those predictions start to come true.  And it's only the start unless the Fed goes hard and fast on taming it which will have other repercussions.  Inflation will exceed expectations possibly coming to 10 annually.    Then the 10 yr treasury yield will punch through the resistance level of 2.8...  And then we will be in a new territory that we haven't been in for 30 years.    The Fed action will determine continued inflation stagflation or deflation.     Enjoy.\n",

      "Want to fix the markets Support the legalization of onion futures.\n",
      "My fellow autismos it's that time again. We need to remind everyone of the ongoing fight that is the legalization of onion futures.   DISCLAIMER I do not currently own any onion futures as such would be illegal. Nor do I have any participating controlling or otherwise beneficiary shareholding interest as specifically pertains to the onion markets or currently illicit onion futures markets or any significantly positive exposure to onions in general save from the onions I get on my Wendy's burgers.   For the newer or more uninformed Effective August 28 1958 the 85th Congress of the United States enacted 7 U.S.C.  131 the Onion Futures Act. The Onion Futures Act is a United States law banning the trading of futures contracts on onions as well as on motion picture box office receipts which was an amendment to a 60 year old law passed in 2010 but whatever your taxpayer dollars at work.   This is absolute horsefuckery.    What 21st century economy exposes their citizenry to the volatility of an unhedgable and unofficiallyrecognized commodities market   With inflation as high as it is now is more important than ever to legalize onion futures. The American people should not be subjected to the volatility of an unhedged onion market.   Look at the recent price increases of these consumer staples   Meat 14.8  Chicken 13.2  Fish 10.9  Eggs 11.2  Milk 13.3   Want to know the reason that there aren't riots in the streets right now over food prices Because distributors and producers used modern financial tools like futures contracts to protect the citizenry from exposure to unreasonable volatility.    Imagine what would happen to consumer staples without milk futures or meat futures or corn futures or wheat futures or soybean or any number of future markets that allow for our economy to absorb volatility in a healthy way.   Want a real world example of the problems with the lack of onion futures Look at what happened in India in 2017. Unhedged volatility in the onion market caused prices to go from $6.12 per 40kg to over $18 for the same lot three weeks later.   Do you want to have to start paying a 0.50 upcharge to add onions to your burger How about doubling the cost of those onion rings your fat disgusting nononionfuturestradingfingers love to shove down your throat Onion powder What about the antioxidant properties of onions The general health benefits Antiobesity and antidiabetic properties as well as antimicrobial properties   I think not.  All of these positives and more can be found in one amazing little edible bulb vegetable composed of several concentric layers.     Now that we are all on the same page about the foundational pillar that onions form in our society why can't we use modern day financial instruments to ensure consistent pricing despite volatility for all   It is with that rallying cry that I call upon you my brothers and sisters of the bulb. Please help us bring stability to an inhumanely volatile world. You can help in the following ways   Contact your congressperson   Contact your senator   Sign our petition \n",

      "Hello Jackoffs  Been shadowing this sub banked on System inc and I banked on Vertical Areospace. Seems that WSB is back so I'm trying my hand at a DD. Not like I was scouring for a stock saw it on social media and as a trader I can confirm its loaded for a moon mission. Ok the ticker BigBear.ai a cyber security firm with contracts with the US Government as well as in the commercial sector.  Since its a cyber firm the stock could also run on a Russia hack day with extra salt being that BigBear.ai getting picked up my news networks. They also have a investor presentation  good overview info on stuff like them predicting russian invasion of crimea and cybersec stuff cyber presentation link  Ok here it is the float is small like 1m shares small  gtThe Company has 135566227 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of April 1 2022. Of these shares 11001307 public shares are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act. Between February and March the Company repurchased 9952803 shares of their Common Stock pursuant to several of their Forward Share Purchase Agreements. In their own words 'as a result of these repurchases the amount of Common Stock trading freely on NYSE may be reduced which could have a material effect on the liquidity of our Common Stock.' Assuming that the shares cannot be sold back into the market and warrant holders do not exercise their warrants on a cashless basis that leaves the tradable float at 1048504.   Heres a paragraph substantiating forward purchase agreements to reduce float from s1a  gtgt On February 22 2022 the Company entered into an agreement with the Glazer Investors and Meteora Investors to terminate each of their respective FPAs and redeem the associated shares which resulted in the Company repurchasing 5.0 million shares for $50625 or $10.125 per share. These shares were repurchased using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger. In March 2022 the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares from the Highbridge Investors to terminate their respective FPAs and redeem the associated shares. The Company paid $24901 or $10.15 per share to repurchase these shares. These shares were repurchased using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger. On February 23 2022 the Tenor Investors exercised their right to sell to the Company approximately 2.5 million shares which constituted all shares held by the Tenor Investors. As of the end of the first quarter of 2022 the Company repurchased all of these shares using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger.  The option chain is loaded. Current OI  15c alone has 130 of the entire float ITM 12.5c are barely 35 hedged lt10 move in commons would mean almost half the float would need to be hedged when 12.5c go itm. Its loaded.  formatpn   Not just for Aprils but for Mays. Look  at the August calls this stock has moved up a good amount and you have calls trading for IV in the 5070 IV Questionable.  formatpn   Thing that made System Inc so great is because of calls like these When SystemInc exploded people selling these calls most likely naked got blown up and you had that beautiful vanna squeeze IV went from 60 to like 1000.  On the short side I got these pictures from the socials   formatpn  formatpn  formatpn   So this is wild a 100 increase in the borrow rate in 1day crazy amount of shorting yesterday but the stock is flat and a 800 borrow rate. Just checked stock isn't flat anymore.  Options cheap with low IV sky high short interest cyber and a lot of OI. Btw you can tell the options are cheap not just by the low IV a stock that can move 40 should not have IV in the 60s but by this as well  formatpn   So yes this stock is thick     The risk is if the SEC gets their shit together and clears a S1 for the first time in like 3m for a despac.  From watching the stock it  has wild swings yesterday it was down like 510 then up the same amount within a few minutes. Or down 10 AH then the next day up 5.   My position x70 520 15c\n",

      "Zoom Video Sucks\n",
      " Zoom Video is Pointless to Have Around  Wall Street Oasis   I have no position in Zoom nor have I ever held any but I NO IDEA why a company like ZOOM Video is first of all around and if you can make an argument for its existence WHY is it trading at such high valuation multiples relative to companies Microsoft Google Cisco Google that have more compelling growth profiles with the financial wherewithal to pursue those paths and  or either offer a competitive service.  Better Substitutes  Zoom's revenue growth has definitely stalled recently and while the market has revised price for it it hasn't adequately done so IMO. There might be a hybrid model going forward but folks will eventually have return to the office what do you think the large corporates will do with the real estate on their portfolio Working remotely might work for some businesses but in most cases particularly with those that have large budgets creativity and productivity will be negatively impacted and these companies already have better alternatives. Think about banks and law firms which are already using MS Office applications for their staff and would rather stick with MS Team. These are extremely sticky relationships that Zoom will never be able to displace and if Zoom tries to build its product offering it will obviously come at a cost to their alreadymediocresubpar cash flow profile  Financial Profile   The company supposedly offers different products but it doesn't really provide any segmentation on topline apart from geography. If their core product offering was growing they would been making a point of highlighting that  Company segments customers into two parts 1 Businesses gt 10 employees and 2 Businesses generating gt100K in revenue.     36 of Zoom's Revenue came from businesses lt 10 employees. These by definition  of people employed are very small businesses don't have significant IT budget and MORE importantly are most likely very price sensitive. If shit hits the fan this 36 will evaporate quickly      Cost of acquiring these customers generating gt 100K in revenue has been increasing over the years while the LTV  CAC ratio a key metric that you look at for tech companies has just never been compelling enough to warrant such a valuation. For acquisition costs I am factoring in 25 of COGS and allocating 100 of  Sales Marketing General Admin  while the 25 is an assumption for the rest of the cateogries the company states that the primary cost in the other buckets is personnel costs. You can agreedisagree with the exact s here but the thesis doesn't change i.e. LTVCAC is poor and has been falling over the years. For LTV it's the gross margin on these largest accounts that presumably the company has been challenging its sales and marketing efforts towards. An IDEAL LTV to CAC ratio should be 31 while for this company it's been 0.2 and more recently has trended to 0.1. Sounds great to me. This becomes even more abysmal to view when you understand that bulk of company's stock compensation over the years has gone to sales and marketing folks. Either they are hiring total incompetent staff so their hiring policies are not great or the product itself is so poor and there is no need for it that the sales folks can't really do much. I am willing to bet that it is a combination of both reasons     Lastly the productivity ratio of the company which I define as Revenue  Employee Average Employee Salary isn't great either. Initially it was 1.19x when they went public and though it's gone up to 1.9ish more recently it begs the question if the company's products were THAT HOT why aren't they bringing in more topline especially keeping in view the acquisitions that they have made over the last couple of years to the tune of more than $300 million. Again same argument as before either incompetent staff whacky hiring policies no need for the service and  or just poor capital allocation      I also believe that the company misleads investors and is trying to paint a more rosy picture of its Free Cash flow by not including adjustments that it should make otherwise. Why are marketable securities which are short term investments being classified in the cash flow from investing activities AND NOT operating cash flow sounds more like a working capital item to me. PLUS they re not really factoring in acquisitions only stuff relating to PPE. If you start incorporating all these adjustments you notice that their cash flow profile is just plain terrible  they've gone from a 4 margin Cash Flow  Revenue to an outstandingly negative 40 in 2022    Legal Proceedings  In recent memory I also really can't think of any such TECH DARLING that got ensnared in either litigation or had security breaches happen on its platform since going public this soon or in a relatively short amount of existence. Think about it if the technology and all was REALLY that good would such events happen These black swan events in my view point to the fact that there is nothing propretiary about what this company is doing. I haven't even looked to explore patents or lack of because the offering is so basic it is essentially Skype that it would be a futile attempt to investigate   Valuation  This just amazes me that on EV  Revenue basis applicable for high growth companies or companies that haven't fully  up yet Price to Book Value Price to Cash Flow Basis and Price to Earnings basis the company just trades at a high premium keeping all the above in mind relative to the average of the following analogues Cisco Microsoft Google Amazon Sales Force and has INFACT traded at higher levels since its publicmarkets debut compared to the levels during either the post IPO years for the analogues or since these analogues have come to the market i.e. went public. I know that Amazon doesn't really have a video conferencing platform unlike others but the reason behind selecting it was because it came to the market with something unique that did not exist before yet didn't get the same valuation. Same goes for Google Google Meet Salesforce Slack and Microsoft TeamsSkype. Now these companies excluding Amazon but including Cisco which offers Webex are still not being priced that highly as Zoom is for which the only reason I can think is maybe the regulators break the tech giants up but that is too much time consuming and too much hassle for regulators so I doubt it plus it's not as if these companies will give up their land that easily so which again begs the question and makes me sound like a broken record that why is Zoom being looked at so favorable when it neither has ANY competitive moat nor does it really have a strong financial profile or a track record of executing its goals. Yes it's board of directors and all may be impressive but these are not the folks on the ground running the company.\n",

      "TLDR   Bearish on Musk Buying Twitter Buy TWTR Sep 42 Puts for $4.40share or less  Bullish on Musk Buying Twitter Sell TWTR Puts for more than Strike Price  $54.20   In case you haven't already heard Elon Musk wants to buy twitter. SEC Filing  The offer was stated to be best and final. Whether or not that's actually true is yet to be seen.      Here are the obvious outcomes along with the probability based on yesterday's option open interest   Twitter accepts the offer.      Shareholders are paid $54.20share.      Market Estimated Probability 65  Twitter rejects the offer Musk stays a shareholder.      Price has a small dip but is otherwise flat.     Market Estimated Probability 15  Twitter rejects the offer Musk dumps his shares.     Price falls back to preMusk levels.     Market Estimated Probability 20   Market is currently pricing in a 20 chance of scenario 3 happening. I think that probability is higher especially considering how volatile Musk can be.   I recognize there may be new option buying to reflect the new probabilities. I can check that after 5pm NY time and adjust my position on Monday.   Implied volatility for the April through August strikes are very elevated which reduce potential riskreward on the play.  So I'm looking to buy TWTR Sep 42 Puts for $4.40share or less as I think there's a better than 20 chance that Twitter rejects Musk's offer and Musk sells his shares.  For those who want to inverse me you can sell Puts for any strike above $54.20 so that you can collect the premium and the proceeds from the acquisition price of $54.20\n",

      "   Respected Traders and Investors   I hope you traders are having a fantastic blast since March FOMC 16th. Making the money up in the 3rd strongest bear market rally and then also on the way down. Congratulations guys. You guys are awesome..   But yeah not so much for investors. Things have been crazy lately for people whose investing horizon is less than 2 years. As for passive investors with a time horizon more than 10yrs well i guess they are still cold chilly as the weather in Antarctica with diamond hands.   Stocks Bond Market Winter  Dividend  Commodities XD   Its really been a long time guys. So quick recap for those who are new to my channel and what we have predicted so far.  _______________________________________   I said an exit liq rally will come in q2q3 after March 16th. FOMC.   March 16 FOMC aftermathformatpn   I also said that in the last weeks of march there will be weakness in the market and it might last till cpi or minutes in april.   Weakness in the last week of March and Aprilformatpn   So far I have been correct. And hey don't forget the most important thing i have been trying to superimpose in everyone's mind by repeating it that in Q4 202223 we will have a recession.  Basic theory  As calculated by 624 months after inversion of the curve   _____________________________________   Also we have been discussing the importance of war in Russia Ukraine  Still going  Sovereign Debt crisis  Lebanon Srilanka Russia after my post  Covid  Do you guys see how corporate people are using their power to avoid shutdown even though CDC is telling to  China Yuan reserve currency  Its happening. Zoltan wrote a great piece about it in his work BW 3  etc in the comments section. I have to say you guys are super smart. I was never expecting that my post would be read by some of the professional people in the investing world. So thank you...   Sorry guys  But im still writing about it. Feels like i'm writing a book on Sovereign Debtformatpn   _____________________________________   Some other calls that I made   1. My bond bust calls are going well too. Hopefully by June bond carnage will stop.   We talked about this theory technically in Credit Risk Americaformatpn   Personally i haven't told anyone to short bonds cause when some of you asked me I told you it's too late. But do keep an eye on CDS and time it with recession. You could make 201 this time around.   CDS in USA 5yr. These things went up dramatically before Recession and Credit Risk.formatpn   2. DXY has also gone to $100 just as we predicted as it's a basic Wyckoff accumulation pattern of 20yrs. The only thing that remains is when the FED will inject QE and debase their currency again. I have told this too to some of you in the comments section that i see it happening after the recession not before.   DXY is at $101 now. So you can see how far we have come from.formatpn   3. Cash is Haven  Yah i know most people wont agree with this thought. But my readers know how well it's going to hold up to cash.   Why is cash importantformatpn   Do you know why I said so  Because I was waiting for an option other than  TINA  Its bonds. That's why I told you all to HODL cash. Now some might argue well how are we going to fight inflation. Well you can't this year but surely in 10yr you can. You just have to look at Real Bond yields chart. They are positive. Meaning investors are keeping an eye on that. And i can sure as hell tell you Bank of America is buying coz they have set their targets 2.35 at 10yr note.  So buy bonds and you get a halfyearly payment on it. And when that payment arrives in lets say Q4 or the 2023 recession. Buy your favorite moneymaking stocks at a cheaper price or Gold coz Gold too falls in Recession. It's that simple strategy. And also pray that bonds don't get obliterated in this coming recession like a 4sigma bubble collapse. I'm betting things will take turns. First bonds then the housing market later on putting pressure on stocks and the word which i cannot speak here.  But the key would be to buy which bonds and at what time  So i would recommend a 2yr  5yr for flipping and 10yr bond as an investment. Time would be May June period. So time it with your T.A. on bonds using Daily and weekly TF. I have given you the month.    Billionaires Buy Zone for TLT  16 May  16 June 2022formatpn  So I think I have given you a rough idea of what we have predicted so far. But as time progresses things could turn but so far it's all going according to our plan.  _________________________________________   It's been the longest recap in the history of the WSB i suppose. But now lets move on from this and take a look at what has happened these past weeks and how are we gonna trade in MayJune intelligently so that we don't get lost in the volatility jungle.  Key events that have happened and some that are coming up    1. Earnings Season   a Bank Earnings    Banks   JP Morgan  ____________  So JP Morgan kicked off with earnings last week. I must say something seems fishy there with Nickel Trading and their losses in Russia. Just like any other conspiracy theorist i cannot help but wonder that the books are being cooked there. Regardless though i love Jamie Dimon and if you are reading this sir you did a great job this decade. I wish you Happy Retirement early on. Wall Street will miss you when you leave office this year.  Highlights of earnings   gt People have more cash in q1 than q4. I bet some of the people took profits  gt There was a rise in debt by people. And combined credit  plus debt rose 21 compared to last year.  gt Earnings were bad for JPM. Hence EPS low. They suffered some losses in Russia and also the transactional revenue has declined. But they offered share buybacks from May 1 which is bullish. Overall if you are investing in banks it's complicated. But hey some institutions think JPM is trading at a discount of $2030 so there's that.   Goldman Morgan stanley  _____________________________  The same was the story with these two giants. Making money. Their traders made a killing in q1. but trading revenue isn't that high compared to last yr. And consumers are still spending like no tomorrow.   Bank of America  __________________  gt Defaults are lower than 2019 levels..  gt Mortgage rate up  gt Q1 opened more credit cards. And they are spending more.  gt Relaxation by China later on in Q2 and Russia situation by Victory Day  They believe it. Not me   So overall i would say we kinda expected this from bank earnings. They didn't beat our expectations by huge numbers and they all took a hit from Russia. Going into Q4 we would see rates yields up and a steepening curve. So banks should do well theoretically. Well they aren't for now. But that could soon change once we get more clarity from the FED. Otherwise we are gonna get a financial crisis on top of a recession.   b Tech Earnings    Next week is so important guys. Stay sober.   56 mega cap tech giant making up $8T dollar market cap are coming next week. They carry the entire  on their backs. Lets see how they perform next week. Finger crossed.  But lets talk about this hilarious Dotcomstyle chart from a company called Netflix. What a script it has written. I feel sorry for Bill Ackman that i really wanna invest in it. Kidding XD   Netflix  My Buy entries  White Lines formatpn   Lets analyze what happened with it  1. The Advertizing business is getting hit by Apple. It happened in January too with NFLX FB SNAP. And soon Google will follow Apple's path. 2. Inflation man. Its killing the future earnings of growth stocks combined with increased competition from HBO Max Disney and Apple TV which are seriously more good than netflix content. 3. Took hit from Russia Ukraine and Elon Woke tweets. Hence Lost subscribers. 4. Its strategy of pricing power by doubling amounts and flip flopping on password sharing didn't work out as they hoped.  remember those tweets from before   Overall its a consumer discretionary growth stocks and not worthy to be named together with FAANG. I'll go with MANGA from here now  MSFN  AAPL  NVIDIA  GOOGL  AMZN  Meta and Netflix need a break.  Note  Even though NFLX got steam rolled from every part you could think of. But it's soon going to have a pullback from Stranger Things 4 which no one is talking about. So trade well my friends but remember don't get attached. It will fall to $120130 later on is what i believe.  83 crash. Love that number  Could possibly go to $6080 in recession. Would be a good buy then for next 10yrs.  I also wanted to talk about Twitter.   Twitter Bullish Chart if Elon Buys the Companyformatpn   Just by looking at charts from back to December 2013 you can probably see that the company hasn't done anything innovating. Maybe that's what you get when you run a company on Blood money  The person who created the platform is out   So as we all know Elon wants to buy the company because he wants to bring free speech to one of the biggest networking platforms of our generations. He could have built his own social networking media company like Trump did. But he understands the power of the networking effect. Hence he pitched his offer of $54.20  i would look it as May 4 420 means  crazy times at FOMC  and freed up some cash.  So the board of directors can either take it or leave it. But the chart says to me that they don't want to give up a financial weapon and promote free speech. Hence they are taking the poison pill approach against Elon's hostile takeover.  So Elon comes up with an argument and says every board has a fiduciary duty towards its share holders. And it should take steps to benefit the company. So the board decided lets just calm the environment themselves and gave up a holiday to employees who were worried of getting fired by Elon Musk. That just speaks to me of the direction in which the company is headed.  Imo this board either has a magical plan to turn the ship around or they are just too dumb to recognize the potential of this company.  Only time will tell what's going to happen.   2. May 34  Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC   Powell Brainard Daly  President of San Fransico   Summers  Former FED Secretary of the Treasury 19992001  Bullard  President of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis   These 5 guys have eaten the head out of me. Why in the world do we have to keep watching them as they speak.   FED buy sell indicatorformatpn   Especially Powell guys. I am beginning to think that the FED has lost all credibility. They are being dishonest and rigging the market. Look at Sarah Eisen at FED. She basically asked Powell everything before the IMF presentation and took a short position. She put Powell on the spot by asking tough questions like Do you want the market to go lower and about Rate hikes.  To which Powell replied Ahhhhhhhhh for the first and the second one 50bps is on the table  Markets crashed immediately that day and the day later when reports emerged of 50bps being priced for May  June  July. Just wow.  We went from Inflation is transitory  25bps gradual hikes in March 16 FOMC to consecutive 50bps with faster tightening cycles. And also removing balance sheet accomodation.  Lets look now at FOMC to see if they actually can live up to their word and hike 50bps. If they did well its pretty much priced in and we don't have to care much about the first 100bps but if they went with 25bps. Markets should go up.  Also the FED fund future is now targeting 3.25 for EOY. Lets see how it all unravels. Personally i would watch Overnight repo and Spreads even though last time like in 2018 case wont happen. Because now the FED has a facility watching for unusual rates movements.  Also do look out for the data in USA GDP. 2 quarters of ve GDP is recession.   3. May 6  Jobs report  Like it or not the jobs market is overheated. A wage price spiral started to happen in January report but not so much now. Maybe this report of may could show us that again.  For now I dont think Job's numbers matter much now. More of the jobs added to the current est. only gives FED more initiative to hike rates as they like or talk like 75bps or even 100bps.  But here's an interesting chart that I would like to share that literally no one is talking about.   Recession  Gray U reverse Orange  Wage growth yoy Red  CPI yoy White  FED funds rateformatpn   I would like to point out two but maybe you guys can find three interesting things in the chart   1. If inflation gt or near the proximity of wage then the FED hands are forced to increase the FED funds rates and cause recession. 2. During the tightening cycle wages tend to decrease downwards later on. This would mean that companies would come under some kind of pressure during this phase of the cycle. 3. Is your H.W. XD   4. May 9  Victory Day  So why is this day so important. Well top professionals say like 1000 crazy but drunk people like me on Wallstreet think that the stock market hasn't seen quite huge a selloff as it should. Maybe the reason behind it is the fact Buy at the sound of cannon and sell at the noise of trumpets rally is going on and its creating an opposite effect to FED put theory  I am sure you must know about Greenspan Bernanke and now Powell put. I dont know how Janet Yellen missed the train. Comments down below XD  This theory is quite simple. You buy at peak fear and you sell at peak greed. Kinda like Bad news is good news and good news is bad news. I hope you all are getting my point.  You can also check historical returns i am sure that would back my theory.  Here's the last time when similar situation happened. And people i apologize beforehand if this chart brings back haunting memories from the past or you have situations related to it.   Afghanistan War  Invasion October 2001  Buy and sell later on bw 5690 days.formatpn    This is my current projection. Lets see how this works out.formatpn   5. May 11  CPI  Consumer Price Index   Well I am sure by now everybody has figured out what happens during the CPI and what data we look for. For those who dont know. Well allow me to explain   Nowadays we all know the CPI will come higher.  So 34 days before the CPI the market starts selling off. But when CPI exp. comes out lower then the market starts to go up.  But when CPI gets released there are always some few things that bother everybody and make a issue out of. So the market decides to sell regardless. Buy the rumor good CPI and sell the news CPI and then go up a few days later.  If the horrible CPI comes out then go much lower than we started that up rally.   Oil Gas prices moving up   There are few metrics that are deciding whether it's a good or bad CPI report  a Core PCE inflation  Well this is the inflation that FED targets cause its from the demand side. Its the CPI inflation minus the food and energy. We need to see it decrease month over month so that we can see the inflexion point in the curve when supplydriven inflation comes down.  b The Headline Inflation  This is the headline number inflation which comes out to scare off the people. This number constitutes the food and energy part which recently has been called Putin Price Hike in America.  Note  The inflation you're seeing is not only from Putin but also from the excess money printing and helicopter money distributed after the pandemic. The value of the dollar has gone down significantly and it takes about 2yrs to see the full effect of monetary policy which you're seeing it now.  So the same case could be made for this tightening cycle if it actually went through which would let us see the bottom of all bottoms in late 20232024. But no doubt you can see some strong reaction rallies in the bear market too. I hope that makes sense.   Closing thoughts   Well now I wanted to talk about how Nasdaq SP500  Russell 2000 and Dow Jones might witness a price action which would take a route using my fundamental analysis with technical analysis.  But sorry guys i'm busy and have to go somewhere. You guys can check out the technical analysis down below and time it with your own fundamental analysis.     Nasdaq 100formatpn  But still i might give you a hint.  Case 1   As we all know April doesn't look so good so far. But im expecting a comeback rally in the last weeks of April provided if the tech earnings are good enough that it impresses the investors. Once we go up then sell in may gets activated because you cant get past the extreme risk off weeks till CPI at May 11. But hopefully month over month core pce comes down and then we kickstart the bear market up rally again till last few weeks of May.   or the other thing that could happen is   Case 2   The tech earnings doesn't impresses investors. We go down. More people start buying FED puts for FOMC and it piles up so much that we go down horribly before FOMC. Powell then comes out in the interview and calms everything down. And hopefully we go up again and get slightly pulled off by CPI but then CPI comes good and we kickstart the up rally again to last few weeks of May and sell again before FOMC.  P.s  I didn't feel like writing these past few days. Because my post was getting rejected last time for no reason at all. Its still there and i would like that if you enjoyed this piece of mine. Do check that one out.   Your guide to Q2 USA stock Market  ____________X_______________X_______________X________________X________________X______________X______________   Until next time guys.

      " VIX in Uptrend.  2020 and 2018 flash crashes did not exhibit prolonged volatility runups. They were volatility spikes. All major volatility spikes on VIX are followed by a downtrend with intermittent volatility spikes. This holds true the time period of listing.  Going back to '91 there are 3 instances of VIX in a prolonged uptrend. These are 19961999 20072008 and now in 2022.  When the 19.34 resistance on VIX becomes support it is typically followed by a long period of volatility and a bear market. 19.34 on VIX is clearly a critical resistancesupport mark for major market events.

      "Hi everyone I have recently entered into a call position on Nutrien $NTR due to technicals and macro news. First a little bit of background Nutrien Ltd. provides crop inputs and services. It offers potash nitrogen phosphate and sulfate products and financial solutions. The company also distributes crop nutrients crop protection products seeds and merchandise products. Basically Nutrien provides a lot of fertilizer needed for industrial scale farming. They are a sizeable company with a market cap of nearly 60 billion and they also pay close to a 2 dividend. The dividend is not why im in this stock however. Im in it mainly for the technical set up.  Daily chartformatpn  First of all Nutrien has seen a drop as of recent. This is most likely a result of the massive run up it has been having since feb. The stock has now bounced on the 50 ema and 38.2 retracement from the run up. This leaves the stock on good grounds to resume its rally.  Hourly chartformatpn  Now looking at the hourly chart the stock is on the cusp of breaking through resistance almost did today but market dropped eod. It is also on the verge of filling a gap of nearly 2.5 which can happen in a days span. Combined with the fact that earnings are around the corner Nutrien is poised to pop. One final thing to mention is being a fertilizer company they stand to benefit from the fertilizer shortage as im sure their pricing has increased. There is also higher demand as crop prices have increased and farming season is underway. That being said I believe they will crush ER.  The June 17 option chain has $200mil or more of OI on the call side. There is 30k OI $15mil on the 105 strike alone. To me this means that a lot of big money is just parked for a rally.

So I am both straddling and strangling options and need to know how the wash sale rule affects me in the case that I take a profit larger than my loss and close my position and then repeat with the SAME company when I see fit.   So quick example Apple opens at $150 and I play the 152.5 call and the 147.5 put lets just say they each cost $100 and Im in for $200 total one side runs up to $150 a con while the other only drops to $70 a con leaving a $20 gain.   Now lets say I repeat the strategy the next day with Apple in the exact same way and it worked out the same way leaving a $20 gain again so now Ive put a total of $400 during these 2 days to make these trades and my gain on one side following my example led to the contracts on the profitable side being worth $300 while the loosing side is left with a total value of $140 which leaves the $40 gain.   My question is will the $140 on the loosing side completely screw my taxes since I played the exact same company on back to back days or will I only be taxed on the $40 overall gain\n",

I do want to point out the increased activity around $150P$160P. That appears to be what is being priced in by institutional participants.   formatpn  The vast majority of the open interest looks to be at the $150 strike while most of the hedging activity looks to be between $150 and $160  Most of the open interest is pricing in a drop. Surprisingly someone has been buying a ton of 0429 $120P. Maybe speculative apes  Over the last couple days in the run up to earnings IV has gone from 40 to 160 and will likely continue to 200 by market close.  formatpn   FB is also quite far from its delta neutral Green line. Most recently delta neutral has been a point of resistance. That may continue to be true for foreseeable future. Notably the increased put buying has brought delta neutral down. Source    formatpn  Current ATM options show the probable range after market close of $166  $190.50.  I'm anticipating a drop but still want to make money so I need to make sure the options contracts I buy are profitable at the $150 mark which currently represents a 16 decrease from yesterday's close. It's possible all this dropping is priced in from the previous quarter. It's also possible that Meta's headwinds have accelerated and further future statements will paint a more dire picture of the company.  Remember that the cost of IV crush will be massive. So you need to pick a strike price that you reasonably expect will expire ITM.  So with that being said these are the positions I intend to open before market close   0429 155P at $2.75 or less  0429 157.5P at $3.00 or less  0429 160P at $3.25 or less  0429 160P at $4.50share  Unclear to what point I can get fills at these prices but I'm going to try.  Edit Doesn't look like I'm gonna get filled at the prices I want.  Edit2 Stock price went up and probably hit the high for today so bought 0429 160P for $4.50. Not ideal but this is probably the best price I'm gonna get. Need FB stock to be at $155.5share at market open to break even.  Edit3 Rip my puts. Post market is surprisingly $200\n",

      "Hi everyone I have recently entered into a call position on Nutrien $NTR due to technicals and macro news. First a little bit of background Nutrien Ltd. provides crop inputs and services. It offers potash nitrogen phosphate and sulfate products and financial solutions. The company also distributes crop nutrients crop protection products seeds and merchandise products. Basically Nutrien provides a lot of fertilizer needed for industrial scale farming. They are a sizeable company with a market cap of nearly 60 billion and they also pay close to a 2 dividend. The dividend is not why im in this stock however. Im in it mainly for the technical set up.  Daily chartformatpn  First of all Nutrien has seen a drop as of recent. This is most likely a result of the massive run up it has been having since feb. The stock has now bounced on the 50 ema and 38.2 retracement from the run up. This leaves the stock on good grounds to resume its rally.  Hourly chartformatpn  Now looking at the hourly chart the stock is on the cusp of breaking through resistance almost did today but market dropped eod. It is also on the verge of filling a gap of nearly 2.5 which can happen in a days span. Combined with the fact that earnings are around the corner Nutrien is poised to pop. One final thing to mention is being a fertilizer company they stand to benefit from the fertilizer shortage as im sure their pricing has increased. There is also higher demand as crop prices have increased and farming season is underway. That being said I believe they will crush ER.  The June 17 option chain has $200mil or more of OI on the call side. There is 30k OI $15mil on the 105 strike alone. To me this means that a lot of big money is just parked for a rally.

Like 30000 gain over principal spent of like 10k as I was rolling almost purely Netflix puts for 2 years  knowing the price was asinine. Unfortunately I lost my job and had to recently stop my strategy which I thought oh well I was wrong. I now see that I was clearly correct   The price dropped so much at once and Gary Gensler stated 95 of retail orders hit dark pools. 95 of buys 95 of sells Or 91 of buys and 99 of sells   His statement was ambiguous on purpose.     These two factors allude that price discovery is simply broken as they don't define the direction of rerouted orders. A company the size of Netflix covered by 1000's of analysts moving this much is just fucking dumb. It seems their price raise password crackdown are simply Wallstreet's journalistic answer for the masses to prevent genuine price scrutiny. I am a hater of Netflix but also can acknowledge that their price raises have historically done very well and a password crackdown has minimal downside as you only lose people not currently paying. Maybe ya lose a few others but it is clearly a net benefit.    I feel cheated and I think others should as well as we had some of the brightest minds of wallstreet covering Netflix.    TLDR  Netflix  large corporations should never drop this much on known information. It's all routed in price manipulation price discovery is a joke.\n",

      "Musk Defeats Investor Claims That Teslas SolarCity Deal Was Improper\n",
      "_mediumsocia_sourcetwitte_contentbusines__sourcetwitte_contentbusines_  Tesla Inc. cofounder Elon Musk wont have to hand over as much as $13 billion in shares of the electric car maker he got in a buyout of SolarCity after a judge found he isnt liable for backing the deal.  Delaware Chancery Court Judge Joseph Slights III concluded the multibillionaire  who recently agreed to buy socialmedia powerhouse Twitter Inc. for $44 billion  didnt improperly use his influence with Tesla directors to prod them to acquire the struggling solar power provider Musk founded with his cousins. Tesla investors demanded Musk return Tesla shares he received as part of the $2.6 billion deal in 2016.  Slights found Musk who served as SolarCitys chairman and largest shareholder at the time of the purchase wasnt improperly on both sides of the deal and didnt ram it through at the expense of Tesla shareholders. Disgruntled investors argued SolarCity was insolvent at the time and not worth the price. They also said Musk failed to properly remove himself from the deals details.  The preponderance of the evidence reveals that Tesla paid a fair price  SolarCity was at a minimum worth what Tesla paid for it and the acquisition otherwise was highly beneficial to Tesla Slights said in his 131page ruling.  The ruling burnishes Musks reputation as a freewheeling entrepreneur who relishes going against the grain as he runs the worlds largest maker of electric cars and spares Musk what could have been a substantial ding even to his vast personal fortune. It also may reinforce the nickname Teflon Elon for winning a case many thought hed lose.  Musk 50 is the worlds richest person with wealth valued at $253 billion. His Twitter acquisition features one of the biggest leveraged buyout deals in history. Hes taking private a 16yearold social networking platform that has become a hub of public discourse and a flashpoint in the debate over online free speech.  In the SolarCity case investors accused Musk of improperly prodding Tesla directors to sign off on the SolarCity buyout at a patently unfair price following a highly flawed process in order to bail out family members Slights said in the ruling.  He was the only Tesla director to challenge the investors claims in court. His board colleagues agreed to a $60 million settlement of allegations by disgruntled shareholders that they were duped into backing the SolarCity deal. That accord was funded by insurance covering Teslas officers and directors.  During a trial last year Musk fenced with investors lawyers over his handling of the SolarCity deal and his predilection for making outrageous statements while running the electriccar maker.  To be honest I dont want to be the boss of anything he said on the stand. I dont want to be CEO. I tried not to be CEO of Tesla but I had to or it would die. I rather hate being a boss. Im an engineer.  In his testimony Musk acknowledged helping hire lawyers to guide the deal through board confirmation and holding weekly meetings to light a fire under the due diligence process.  He maintained that the solar power company was on a solid financial footing but had said in an internal memo the firm needed to solve its liquidity crisis. It turned out SolarCity was hemorrhaging cash and in danger of defaulting on its debt according to court testimony.  But Musk dismissed claims of impropriety having recused himself from deliberations over the deal and been barred from the Tesla directors final approval vote.\n",

PCE is Friday  and FOMC is next Wednessday. SO I think sideways trading till then at  least   OR we DROP into a 25 to 40 CRASH.   THE 3rd Possibility is that we go to a brand new high of 500 by middle of JULY.   Why July Read on weary reader.  Last and Final Note.   GUESS WHEN the BEAR FLAG CHANNEL RESISTANCE line HITS 469.   THAT'S  RIGHT you guessed it MIDDLE OF JULY Just like 1 year prior to  that when the market took 3.69 DUMP on the 3rd week of JULY finished  dump on next Monday  So it is  likely that in a market where everything has dropped to NEW LOWS EXCEPT a  select few stocks the market is either BOUND to BOUNCE off of this  fabled 420 OR is it DOOMED to be RESET. I have a firm belief that the  market can no longer handle a drop below 420. We are in the clouds it  is either MOON or SPLAT now. Below 420  margin calls and liquidations.  So  do YOU think that the Fed or MMs or whoever the F controls the markets  will let the market CRASH or take it to a new HIGH because they know  everyone's trading habits and patterns and access to everyone's money  plus who knows how much more money might suddenly be printed for  stimulus checks or cancelling student loans. Rich don't care about  inflation they make more money when the market inflates.  That was a Question please answer it.\n",

Reasons The PPI index cost inflation in Germany soared by 30.9 in March compared to March 2021. This is the maximum increase since 1949 and then let me remind you there was a postwar famine and a shortage of energy resources in Germany.  Energy prices jumped by 83.8 last month including natural gas rose by 144.8. Food has risen in price by 12.2...  Of course PPI does not always go headtohead with CPI consumer inflation. Sometimes inflation becomes less due to the loss of business margins. But anyway 30 inflation at a key rate of 0 is something surreal ....It is completely incomprehensible who will need such a EURO ...   Meanwhile EU energy groups agree to fulfill Putin's conditions on Russian gas  this is the headline of the Financial Times editorial published today.

      "I've noticed that people take advantage of IV leading up to earnings and I am wondering how that works. For example Amazon's AMZN earnings is tomorrow 0428 AH. ITM and ATM options are incredibly expensive due to volatility. Ex. one 2760C 0429 is worth about $9.6k 2DTE. And so I've seen people buy far OTM options hold until earnings and sell it hopefully for a profit.   Now the 2000P 0429 is worth about $95 with an IV of 179. Is this something that one would purchase tomorrow and sell before EOD Or is it too late and should have been bought earlier Would the intraday movement of the stock matter since its way OTM and essentially we are taking advantage of IV leading up to earnings. I imagine this would be absolutely worthless after earnings since it expires 0429 and there's likely no way that AMZN would even drop that low.   I have no positions but would appreciate any insight on this strategy thanks.\n",
      "THE HOUSING MARKET IS GOING TO GRIND TO A HALT....\n",
      "The current dynamics in the housing market are unlike anything seen in decades if ever. Prices are at all time highs supply is scarce rates are rising and refi activity has plummeted. Housing faces a set of headwinds AND tailwinds at the same time creating a pressure cooker in a very important sector of the economy.  The median price of an existing home sold in March was up 15 percent to a record of $375k. Total homes for sale at the end of last month was 950K a 2 month supply of inventory. The rates on a 30 year fixed mortgage have gone up about 200 basis points since the beginning of the year from slightly above 3 to over 5 currently. Refi activity has plunged almost 70 in the last year.  The opinions of the housing market range from one extreme to another. Some are calling for a complete bust as prices have reached unsustainable levels and can't possibly go any higher. Others look at lack of supply and an economy flush with cash and see only continued price appreciation especially in the face of break neck inflation. The reality in my opinion will likely be a crushing slow down in any activity related to housing.  With interest rates at 5.35 most homeowners who could benefit from a refi usually a 1 rate improvement have either done it already or it no longer makes sense to. This is after a paltry 25 basis point hike by the FED. Once a couple of 50 basis point moves happen and rates hit 6.57 refi volume is going to dry up. One year ago refinances made up 61 of total mortgage activity today that number is 35 and has been decreasing at almost double digit levels for months.  On the purchase side mortgage applications are down 17 in the last year and were down 8.3 week over week. Pending sales have been down 5 months in a row. March sales were down 4.5 and listings were down 9.5. Activity on the buying side has been  by increased rates and increased prices at the same time. A 1 increase in interest rates typically equates to a loss of 10 in buying power. Rates have gone up over 2 YTD and prices are up almost 20 in the  last year. Buyers who were already fighting an uphill battle are getting pummeled on both sides of the equation.  The stress in the purchase and refi sides of the housing market is starting to show itself in terms of how deals are financed. Cash has always been king in real estate and is no different now with 28 of sales being cash. The good old ARM has made its way back into the picture currently making up 9 of total loan count and 17 of dollar volume. This doesn't portend a 2008 like collapse by any means but it is an interesting development. A 5 year ARM is currently about 1 lower than a fixed rate making it an option in a rising price and rate world.  Housing inventory countrywide is estimated to be 4 million units short of demand. The CEO of the National Association of Home Builders NAHB just came out appealing to the government for help to stave off a recession in housing as the market continues to slow down on all fronts. There is a real irony to this as the homebuilders have already plotted a course through these times. A look at building permits shows that permits for single family homes are 4.8 in the last month. Compare that to permits for buildings with 5 units which are up 10.9. Housing starts show a similar trend with single family starts 1.7 while starts for construction of 5 units are up 7.5. There are no signs on the horizon that inventory issues are going to change.   The net result of this will be a massive slow down in housing. This may lead to price drops but prices may also keep going up due to cash purchases and lack of supply. Overall volume is going to drop to levels that will make it hard for any type of significant move in price either way. Large buying volume relative to supply is what is needed to keep prices ripping like they have been for years. But that volume is shrinking fast. Conversely large selling volume relative to supply is needed to lower prices in any meaningful way. But who is going to sell their house that has a sub 4 rate to buy another equally inflated house at over 5 For those reasons I don't see any scenario that housing doesn't just slowly grind to a halt....\n",

      "    Going to keep this brief because Ive unfortunately got a sick kiddo at home who so kindly passed it along to me. Gonna try to rest up before tomorrow so I can be on my game. But we had some fairly big things happen today honestly.    formatpn  In the moment its impossible to tell but we essentially just had a massive $6.52 range day today. While also maintaining a slight bull channel that broke as you can see ill show zoomed out below the current bear channel we have been in since last Wednesday. Thats a big win for the bulls    formatpn  For those that follow me you know I am not one to scream manipulation or anything like that. The markets are erratic and in the end we are playing a risky game that most people fail at. I believe only 0.02 of all people in the world are professional successful day traders if my statistics are correct.   Anyways this week has once again been humbling. We need to remember quick profits are king. When we hold through these massive violent days and swings we are just getting ate alive. We also have to accept a bad entry. I struggle with that today especially willing to admit my entry was bad and help a call to 80 that I was lucky enough to recover for 11 before the 2nd dip of the day. But I then got stuck in a call that I now have to carry and definitely dont like the idea of carry it over night. But in the end the choices we make have consequences. When green wins the MM win. We have to remember we have to play their game. If they want violent wild swings thats fine We just take profits early  So lets talk about the fuckery of the day today.   Overnight we had MSFT killing it and of course Google sucking air through a straw. Spy opened up very green this morning and just took off immediately reaching 422.02 by 945a. It was pretty arguable that with the VIX opening at 31.11 after closing at 33.77 the day before and dropping all the way to 29.89 at open that we were going to see one hell of a bull run. At these VIX levels a 23 green day is just as easy if not easier to accomplish then a red 2.9 we saw yesterday.   Well then 10am came and we saw Spy go from its HOD all the way to 415.01 within 30 minutes time. Thats a total of 1.7 drop or a $6 drop in a very short period of time. The VIX also spiked from 29.89 to 32.77 at the same time. And what caused this arguably unnatural sell off Thats a great question. At the time the only notable news was that expected home sales had a massive miss. But you will not sit here and tell me that after 3 weeks of the markets not giving a flying F about CPI PMI or any other actually important economic data that they all of a sudden cared today Sus...          Then the lovely which if you didnt catch it here it is fb oopsies.    formatpn   formatpn  Yes you are reading that correct thats BLOOMBERG fricken Bloomberg accidentally tweeting a massive miss for META earnings. And not only that But they tweeted the INCORRECT data yeah that data was old. How does one manage to post not only incorrect data but also post it in the middle of the day when no one ever releases earnings yeah a little sus if you ask me.   Now why was this important Ah yes let me tell you why So the market had opened bullish af. Tanked on the bullshit at 1015am and FINALLY recovered all the way back to green and made a new HOD Yay SPY. Well right after making the HOD is when that piece dropped at 1pm. And that changed the whole dynamic for the rest of the day. I dont like to scream manipulation or anything but im telling you that someone fucked with the market on purpose today and they won. Oh yeah someone just so conveniently LOADED to the tits with puts RIGHT BEFORE the new dropped sus I mean come on.   Overall after SPY recovered from its morning dip it was setting the stage full steam ahead for an afternoon rally and I have no doubts it was shooting for 425426 EOD. But that meta new not only tanked meta itself to be down 5 at one point but took the rest of the market down with it. I know nothing will ever come from this but this is the type of day that breaks the spirits of a day trader.    formatpn  So where are we    formatpn   formatpn  Well meta absolutely KILLED IT tonight on earnings. I called it out in my server but I did not play it myself but I called it out that meta was going to be a call not put play. It got beat down so aggressively over the last week there was no way they would tank it anymore.   Spy as you can see is reacting VERY positively to that news.    formatpn  The daily chart on SPY has never looked so bullish. I wanna point out the blue arrows to you. So you can see I highlight two from March and then today. What do you see there Especially the one from March 8th the first blue arrow you see a massive sell off that ended at 415 AND had a long ass wicked candle. What did it do the next day It rallied like no one elses business.   So for instance March 8th closed at 0.76 with an intraday range of 2.9 or $12 of movement. The next day it had a 2.68 green day.   March 14th closed at 0.73 with an intraday range of 2.1 or $8.76 of movement. The next day it had a 2.20 green day.  Those of you that follow me know ive been having a working theory of a sideways channel from 415 to 458 for a little while now. This would secure that channel with now 4 supports. Yes someones gonna scream it cant be a channel if a candle breaks it Well it can actually. Its called an outlier. And that candle right there is from the day the Russia war took off. So thats really an outlier.  Now the resistance we have 7 candles rejecting off of it with two outliers above it. Something I am definitely watching for sure.   One thing I do see and know though is that 415 yesterday and today and last month held as great support. Tomorrow which we are above now resistance will be 420. From there we paint the path to 428 which is the daily 8ema and next major resistance. Believe it or not I truly think its doable tomorrow. It would take a large 2.5 day but thats honestly easily obtainable.    formatpn  The VIX never really found its groove today. It supports the sideways range day for sure as we just couldnt really get a direction established and after a very strong ADX yesterday it was very weak all day today. However its important to note just how high the VIX is. The vix does not usually stay in this range. Its happy place is down close to 1920 for the last few months. The VIX is more like to unravel from these levels and cause massive bull runs when it does. Arguably at open today when the VIX immediately dropped and spy rocketed too that was setting the tone for the day. But it was unable to hold below the 30 level and reach 28. With Meta killing earnings and 32 being clearly the top for VIX right now I think we will see this unwind tomorrow and will see the bull rally.    formatpn   formatpn  Apple is still well within its bear channel right now. However it bounced off support today once again at 155. The daily and 15min bear channel supports were tested and held perfectly today. I didnt even have to adjust the yellow bear channel thats how perfect it was.   Now you note the two candles highlighted on apple and yes you guessed it they coincide perfectly with the SPY candles that resulted in rallies So lets dig into these.   March 14th Apple finished down 2.66 with an intraday range of 2.67 or $4.02 of movement it was followed by a massive green day that was 2.97 green with an intraday range of 3.45 or $5.19 of movement.   Today had a 0.15 finished with a total range of 2.83 or $4.41 of movement. So very similar days and ranges. It will be very interesting to see if tomorrow we get that bull rally we are all waiting for.   The markets MAY make us wait until apple earnings but I have a feeling we are going to rally tomorrow off meta earnings and will look for a follow through rally after Apple beats earnings. I dont think personally that amazon is going to beat earnings at all. And I dont think the markets will care either to be honest. Look at google today left in the dust 3.75 and was red all day long even when the markets were at the highs of day.   We will find out in the morning when we wake up how pre market and Europe digests everything but again if I ever was a betting man despite all the fuckery afoot on a markets direction tomorrow being green I feel fairly confident in.   The one thing that will change that is if markets for some reason dont digest overnight meta well or the VIX for some ungodly reason spikes back to 3234 before open.    formatpn  I wasnt going to add QQQ tonight just cause im running outta steam here and my heads killing me but I wanted to point out the exact same candle set up on QQQ that SPY and Apple has And see how wild that swing up was the next day. Just something to keep in mind.   10 challenge  This week honestly has been really rough for me. I took a major loss Monday once again on a bs reversal that was like 1 in 30minutes and yesterday finally recovered to green on the week. Intraday today I had a good call in the morning for 11. I then entered another call at the perfect moment before spy dropped the 1.5. I with conviction or stupidity held from 80 all the way to 5 to 40 back to 10 before I finally sold right before the 1pm sell off. That was a rough time for sure. I also then took another 2dte call that went against me and I got out a 1 thankfully.   As you can see I ended up closing my MSFT lotto for 10 it was a very small position. At open I was up about 5 and then it immediately went red so I just bailed while I could. Of course had I held I woulda been up a lot when it hit that 56 at one point. But I had no belief it would rally that hard intraday.   So thats the good. The bad is I also entered some calls around 230 when I expected the bull trend to continue and immediately saw a drop and red action. So I am currently holding those right now over night. I am holding way move over night then I care to do but I think by EOD tomorrow I should be able to exit everything green.   Call msft lotto 3 dte 10  Call 0dte 11  Call 0dte 11  Call 2dte 1   formatpn   formatpn  Realistically I dont have too far to go on these For the 2dte 422C on spy I only need to see 424 intraday tomorrow to see any green. That is very much so doable for SPY tomorrow.     The 428c lotos from last week are pretty much smoked I need something like 434 by Friday which is pretty doubtful. My goal will be to close those EOD tomorrow or intraday around 50 if I get the chance.   The Apple 165C has a breakeven of 161.3 which is very doable for apple in one day. Itll be tough but its doable. Depending on how im feeling and where those are tomorrow night and what market is doing I MAY hold the apple as a lotto over night for earnings. I havent decided yet.    formatpn  And of course cant forget the hyperwheel that still haunts me as I sleep at night. The good news is im holding the futures contracts still so as long as we get some green under neath us we will be good to go and I will quickly see profits return there. But that 14 hurst a lot to see.\n",

      "gtPt. 1  42022   gt   gtThe rogue VIX spike that leaked out today to spark that morning selloff has happened three other times since Corona on green market days. In all three other instances the spike has been followed by a 20 volatility increase within two trading days afterwards.   gt   gtI started to notice a pattern related to the rogue VIX spikes that will appear completely out of nowhere to cause market selloffs before getting pushed back down by the Fed to keep the markets healthy.   In the three other times that these have suddenly leaked out on green market days there has been a VIX increase of 1820 occur within 2 trading days afterwards.   gtPt. 2  42122   gt   gtUpdate That rogue VIX spike appearing the middle of a green market yesterday has foretold of major volatility increase 4 times now.   gt   gtUpdate to my post yesterday  I recognized something behind the scenes during trading yesterday that I had only observed 3 other times since the corona recovery began.  A  rogue VIX spike anomaly that seemingly leaks out mid day during an otherwise healthy green market.  It appears briefly enough to disrupt the entire market momentarily before getting smothered back down minutes later.     It has only ever happened 3 other times to us during a green market in that manner and had been followed immediately by a major volatility crash to the market.   gt   gtIt would  now seem this is somewhat of an undeniable feature not a glitch as It has now happened 4 times under those exact conditions and every single time it has foretold us that a major volatility increase about to take place within the markets.  Pt. 3  Volatility Suppression and Patterns  Here's my assessment of the situation how I picked up on this strange pattern and what I have concluded is happening.   So what is happening  Why would this occur  First let's get you caught up to what VIX even is   gtThe Volatility Index VIX measures investors confidence of market health and signals the level of fear or stress in the stock marketusing the indexes as a proxy for the broader marketand hence is known as the Fear Index. The higher the VIX the greater the level of fear and uncertainty in the market because of this a major increase to VIX will cause markets to systematically sell off in computerized responsive trading.  You can start to gather from this relationship as to why VIX climbing unchecked at every COVID news update could be problematic to an already tense market in recovery.  The Federal Reserve recognized this importance as well and set in motion a plan to prevent it from continuing to repeat itself.   By June of 2020 it was apparent that the monthly volatility cycles were upending investors and was going to spiral into a larger full blown crash.   As part of the Fed's recovery outline a market recovery team was to be created affectionately known to us as the plunge protection team.   Their algos began to routinely show themselves during trading to prop up the major indexes and provided price support to entire sectors worth of companies stock so our then feeble markets didn't appear outwardly sick in what became known to many as fed pump mornings fed pumps money printer go brr etc..    This set in motion a dangerous policy of the Reserve algorithmically suppressing VIX to c it down and in the process engineer false market confidence to prevent skittish investors from fleeing the markets at the first sign of trouble.  All of these efforts were unprecedented it gave them a level of access and control to our financial markets that had never been seen and the unbridled ability to dictate much of the narrative driving the perception of our recovering economy. From that point on an all out market protection war to save us from ourselves was put underway.  And it worked a little too well.  It led to one of the strongest continuous bull markets in modern history and set the stage for that VShaped recovery that we were so promised.. but at what cost   The cost of lying to the markets falsely propping it up with strings and cheating volatility as a means to suppress the truth of how bad the situation really was to everyone.  And in the process enticing confident investors to pile into positions with margin debt at levels never before seen.  The suppression of volatility creates a debt to the market that must be paid.  It was in these efforts of market control and suppression that myself and others began to notice cracks leaking out that could not be explained.   The exaggerated midday price movements into end of day collapses pump like market behavior inexplicable microcrashes that dotted the recovery at every few month intervals and of course the questionable manipulation of VIX that seemingly defied all market health indicators.   It became apparent early on that c down VIX was something the Fed prized themselves on controlling and for that reason I began watching it just as much as I did my own stocks.  My trading grid contained VIX in the 1 spot followed by my long positionsinterested stocks and it was because of this  setup that I began to pick up on certain irregularities in its' price movement and correlating the effects of these movements on the market as a whole.  To truly understand why these rogue  spike movements jumped out at me you must understand that VIX has very unique price pattern tendencies and normally travels very naturally under live trading and has reactionary impulses that correspond to the current market health ie. climbs during red markets movement that will typically begin gradually while following a back and forth tug and pulling both directions before the next linear climb or drop interval starts  With the anomaly spikes when they begin you would witness an almost vertical launch formation and price climb happen in just minutes.  It would skip entire intervals of numbers per second ie. 11.2  11.3  11.8  12.1 etc.  As the spike was forming for these couple minutes the market goes into a state of paralytic shock and most every index starts to decline and sell off immediately in response.  The rogue price jump was always such that it went against the ongoing sentiment and movement of the live market and currently trending VIX direction large percentage jumps occurring in the midst of a green market which defied implicit behavior tendencies.  In addition there was always an immediate and successful attempt to crash the spike back down to regain market stability for the day to calm peoples nerves before giving the market the full VIX dose over the trading days immediately afterwards.  The only way you can witness these is to experience them while trading and observe the market wide effect and price paralysis that occurs when its forming.   If you were watching your stocks every day during Corona recovery markets you definitely experienced this.  Whether you noticed the relationship to VIX or not.  Why it matters  In the past when we have observed this behavior under healthy green markets it has signaled the point at which the markets are about to incur the volatility debt that the Fed has been sparing us from through their market control measures.  Where it goes from here or how long this market uncertainty lasts is unclear.   What is clear is that VIX has a long overdue climb to fulfill and a debt with the markets to reckon with.  It will be slowed down and even dialed back for periodic intervals to maintain stability and produce green markets but its' climb will likely persist as the pressure it creates is released in a controlled manner.  Which I do not believe has fully happened in spite of the pain this past week has wrought.  Position UVXY calls will be rewarded but should be treated with respecttake profits  and entered at appropriate times.  Puts will print as this process unfolds and the markets reconcile with the true state of affairs.   TLDR  The tape and glue that the fed has employed as a means to prop up a sickly market will spring a leak occasionally showing us how bad of shape the boat is really in the day before it takes on water.   An unintentional side effect of the Feds efforts in suppressing VIX and propping up our markets has berthed a type of early warning alarm that seems to go off in the days before giving you a chance to get a head of it with your trades.  As this most recent one did for me with UVXY calls.\n",
      "Trojan Condom Maker Cautions About Potential Recession Risk\n",
      "Bloomberg  The maker of Arm Hammer baking soda and Trojan condoms cautioned about a possible recession in its firstquarter earnings report.  Church Dwight Co. told investors Thursday that its well positioned for a potential recessionary environment given that 40 of our portfolio is considered value products. The U.S. economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter with gross domestic product contracting at a 1.4 annual rate.  Consumers and businesses are spending at a healthy clip the Commerce Departments figures showed Thursday but a swollen trade deficit was a big drag on growth. Church Dwights cautionary language stands out because few consumer companies have brought up a recession in their earnings reports. Several have pointed to strong underlying demand despite inflation.  A recession is generally defined as at least two consecutive quarters of negative change in GDP. Economists put the chance of a recession in the next 12 months at 27.5 according to 40 respondents in a Bloomberg survey in early April.  Church Dwight has raised prices on 80 of its products over the past year and plans more increases for fabric care and cat litter in July but they havent been enough to stem rapidly rising costs.   The company said it would incur an additional $85 million in expenses for 2022 primarily due to higher oil and transportation prices bringing its fullyear inflation forecast to $240 million. That will result in earnings per share growth of 4 at the low end of the prior guidance.  We expect to experience higher inflation at a faster rate than our price increases take effect Chief Executive Officer Matthew Farrell said in a statement. Church Dwight also plans to combat rising costs with productivity initiatives and changes in product pack sizes.  SourceBloomberg\n",
