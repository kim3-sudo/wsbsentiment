analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10  Oil rose 35 in March reaching a high over 130 per barrel  I am expecting inflation to be at least 85 which is going to shock the markets    Another factor is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now  The covid crash was not a complete recession but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes    The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome  I hate to be that person but over the last year with unemployment decreasing spending increasing and now inflation accelerating this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80 without interfering  At most there will be a 50 bear market similar to 2008  The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell then it should recover in the following days    Not professional financial advice do not solely make your trades based on my opinions I encourage everyone to research more   TLDR

100emas We finally got the close below them today While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days   The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today To color me impressed would be an understatement Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend

heck of a red day today too mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2774 today I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema I did not however expect it to happen today However I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning   Apple now is in an interesting place Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158 However my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again Apple is a risky play here   Channel support tomorrow is 157 unlimited downside and resistance is 1666 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 1686 would be a bullish signal However if Apple loses 16554 daily 100ema we can expect further downside this week   I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning Before the small intraday recovery I may reenter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish   ampx200B  httpspreviewredditrvihq1qxqzs81pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps815d5abea3eb8fcfa988a512045e85dccccf6818  The blood for AMD just continues

breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100 This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 7274 This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right   I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema tomorrow most likely to form an official death cross This should give it some continued downside   ampx200B  httpspreviewreddith42lt6cyqzs81pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps656bccd6c7693ffbff25068cf8b80b2484feb77c  Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 25 however after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in Next major support I see for Ford is around 128 and after that is 112  Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I dont suspect the RSI to be an issue   Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this

called out on SPY that 420430 was support I suspected I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out That tells

very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI   Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday The market with the 10 year rising 30 year fixed mortgages rising again the inverted treasury yields inflation covid war gas etc etc etc recession etc etc etc talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two   While some dont think its a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling thats the preample to the downside to come I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow   10 challenge  Today was a fairly good day I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19 a spy put for 20 and a call for 20 I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70 at open that spiked to 30 around the first big drop to 4415 With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at 30 I also played a call and put for 25 then 10 during the sideways chop Followed by during power hour a two separated 10 puts Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal however factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 4415 I would have had a fairly large L to carry Today was a win for me,negative

Inflation is done....kinda,The Fed controls the supply of money  Supply and demand determines value  Just like oil when a lot of supply goes into the market the value of oil goes down  Same thing with money    We do not have a demand issue  The base economy fuckin sucks  We have a supply issue where the Fed supplied so much money into the market they reduced the value of money and caused inflation  Well now it's the opposite  They will be taking out excess supply making the value of money go up to reverse the effects of inflation  BUT they will cause a recession that may already be here   The main component of an economy is consumer spending  Investment government spending and net exports are the others  Inflation is already affecting consumer spending which affects demand which eventually affects employment  The Fed will tame inflation by removing money supply and likely overtame inflation causing a recession  As debt service costs go up consumer demand will decrease and corporations will look to lay off people   We are starting a nasty cyclethat will essentially lead to little or no growth for the next 5 to 10 years   The Fed will again take too long to reverse the inflation taming  But the problem is that we don't actually have a demand driven inflation with a robust economyso what is the end result going to be  Deflation    How long for I got no fuckin idea  So we will start a deflationary process in the next 618 months and the only option will be 0 and printing money again   Expect that within 24 months the printer goes brr again  Yesno one has said this yet but the Fed may cause a deflationary spiral especially if they don't act properly   The problem is I have no idea what to do but I do know one person that does and consistently beats the market when times are tough for equitiesMr Buffet  Go with BRKB and close your eyes for the next 12 months,negative

Real estate market and the broader economy,I know there will be lots of just short the housing market bro responses but I am more interested in the opinions of the OG WSB autists if you guys are still around. Full disclosure I'm not involved in this market.   Papa powell lowered fed rates to almost 0 during the beer virus and printed paper so there were lots of easy money. This money first went into stonks and the market became too hot. Institutional investors had to find an alternative asset class and it seemed like they went into real estate.   As you have noticed the housing market went crazy over the last few years. However I also noticed this insane price hike is mostly for starter homes  aka the houses for entrylevel buyers getting their first home. These starters are singlefamily housesapartmentsduplexescondostownhouses you get the idea. In contrast my older wealthy friends' gt$1M mansion had seen maybe 300k increase while the starter houses my younger friends are looking to buy increased by x2 or x3.   Investors instead of home buyers purchased gt18 of all real estate sold in Q3 2021 alonehttpswww.redfin.comnewsinvestorhomepurchasesq32021. Firms like BlackRock has bought 66 apartment complexes in my city  not units entire complexes. I also looked at the prospectus of two REITs Vanguard VNQ and BlackRock USRT and residential is the secondhighest holding in these funds. The top holding is something called Specialized REIT  I wonder if apartment complexes or residential RE holding companies count as such. In both funds' documents they identified increasing interest rates as a significant risk factor. The point is this is just two REITs. There are lots more of these institutional or even individual investors of various sizes buying up starter homes.   ampx200B  With all that said I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on where this is going and how it will end. The following is my speculation and thinkingoutloud so probably not everything makes sense   It seems to me like these institutions are cornering the market by controlling the supply and causing the price to increase and then slowly selling these starter houses to any sucker who would be willing to pay the ridiculous price ... so are they holding a bunch of empty houses waiting for appreciation or are they also renting them out How are the occupy rates   Switching gears  what about the packaging and reselling of these mortgages Anything going on there I know they never stopped selling CDOshttpswww.printfriendly.compgmKya3x after 0809. Like the film ending scene of 'the Big Short' pointed out they are now making 'boutique synthetic CDOs'  and call them 'bespoke tranche opportunity' and there's a lot of activity in producthttpswww.reuters.comarticleidUSL5N22B5Q2.   As interest rates start to increase are institutions gonna fire sale and try to make their rival firms and new home buyers hold the bag I'm not sure of the exact cause or mechanism but if they needed to cooperate and hold it all together they wouldn't  just look at how they handled Bill Hwang's swaps. They all agreed to slowly unwind but right after the meeting when Credit Susse and UBS went to sleep Goldman and Morgan immediate offloaded and tanked those stonks and market in general. That's relatively small in comparison to the entire housing market.   Anyway I would love to hear your opinions thoughts and insights on this. Thanks for reading my rant.,negative

Russian Palladium Refiners banned by London's Platinum and Palladium Market and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange SBSW and other nonRussian Palladium companies stand to gain massively,On Friday the London Platinum and Palladium Market a major trading venue for Palladium and other platinum group metals banned two major Russian state owned Palladium refineries from having their Palladium and Platinum sold on the LPPM's London and Zurich exchangeshttpswww.marketwatch.comstorypalladiumandplatinumpricesjumpafterlondonmarketblocksrussianpreciousmetals11649521364. This was followed up by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also banning the same Russian state owned refiners todayhttpsfinance.yahoo.comnewspalladiumextendsgainssuspensionrussian234518049.html. Additionally the Japanese Exchange Group's Osaka exchange is now also reviewing whether or not to ban Russian Palladium and Platinum refiners. This has major implications in the Palladium market as Russia produces about 40 of the world's Palladium.httpswww.reddit.comrwallstreetbetscommentss72z1uhow_to_profit_off_a_russian_invasion_of_ukraine Russia's Palladium and Platinum exports were one of the very last major Russian exports left that were not subject to any major sanctions. As civilian deaths mount in the RussoUkrainian War more and more pressure will mount on Western governments and financial regulators to cut Russia further out of the world markets. Any removal of Russian palladium from the world market gives an excellent opportunity for nonRussian Palladium producers to profit. Aside from Russia major palladium mines are located in South Africa the United States and Canada. Palladium is used heavily in both the car industry and electronics industry being used in both catalytic converters and integrated circuits. If major automakers and chip makers are no longer allowed to buy Russian Palladium they will be all forced to compete for Palladium produced by companies like Sibanye Stillwater SBSW which controls nearly all of American Palladium mining production and has major mines in South Africa and Impala Platinum Holdings JSE IMP which has major Canadian and South African mines.

41122 SPY AMD QQQ F Apple VIX Daily TA,    The day before CPI the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my 2 red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days.   The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesnt have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema above for bearish and below for bullish.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.it1hpw0uyrqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps89e988c2486c9a35886e64c0572dda7db4c7f52f  We actually established yet another downward channel today that I dont suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itnzmwaslsqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps460f3ed4daf222a62703d594bc51c6a74e98085e  ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itli7lzt7tqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps4347b8f4c091377d1ce4fba1560a3adac832fe92  We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse.   But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I dont really forsee unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10 that we do it but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.  ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itgk5l6gstqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpampsb1186f1a49dfdb4c8482bfe6b8db71a3e6c0a15d  The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.it14m0bnhuqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpampscb628bb79afa7a42f5d89e96ee5161666ca6c136  The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20 50 and 100 ema on the daily 445.21 446.55 and 446.63 but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside.   Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 unlimited upside BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I dont suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itb7xoaqpvqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps7116303960c6b14d65486a7a6055fe9d2f6ebe3b  Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema 443.96 445.9. The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 weekly 50.   Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday monthly option expiration.   Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p.   Thursday monthly has 15k 445c 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p 66k 435p 113k 430p.  That is a massive amount of OI to the downside thats expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too.   With the last CPI being 7.5 expected at 7.9 but the consensus at 8.4 its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war gas prices more covid etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itzvve2nvwqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpampsd6cb5a86ef7f0a6606d8305928378625e0d55be0  Apple had a heck of a red day today too mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today. I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not however expect it to happen today. However I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning.   Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here.   Channel support tomorrow is 157 unlimited downside and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However if Apple loses 165.54 daily 100ema we can expect further downside this week.   I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may reenter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itrvihq1qxqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps815d5abea3eb8fcfa988a512045e85dccccf6818  The blood for AMD just continues but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive 5.2 hit which I believe it was down around 6 at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 7274. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right.   I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema tomorrow most likely to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.ith42lt6cyqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps656bccd6c7693ffbff25068cf8b80b2484feb77c  Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5 however after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.  Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I dont suspect the RSI to be an issue.   Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.it26yjjyxyqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps7e647a1487ff5cbb7889db0f47334e17a6429f2b  QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how.   Channel support is 322 unlimited downside and resistance is 342 for tomorrow.   I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20 50 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itqghek3jzqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps50292337467bbf1fd1b3d55a377e4955d987401b  The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11 from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels but mind you that was on the downside not the upside.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.it1dkbfa40rzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps718eb38d4ea8f47c4467f046cff1e33dd4fed944  When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI.   Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising 30 year fixed mortgages rising again the inverted treasury yields inflation covid war gas etc. etc. etc. recession etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two.   While some dont think its a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of... took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling thats the preample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow.   10 challenge  Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19 a spy put for 20 and a call for 20. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70 at open that spiked to 30 around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at 30. I also played a call and put for 25 then 10 during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10 puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal however factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.,positive

Gapped up and gapped down stocks  good strategy potential, Does anyone here currently use after market gap analysis to identify stock likely to shift dramatically on market next day open  Here's the basics   Gapping occurs when the price of a stock or another asset opens above or below the previous day's close with no trading activity in between. A gap is the area discontinuity in a security's price chart. Gaps may materialize when headlines cause market fundamentals to change rapidly during hours when markets are typically closed for instance the result of an earnings call afterhours.  Gapping may also refer to the difference or spread in rates at which banks borrow and lend. The dynamic gap measures how assets money held and liabilities money loaned change over time.  Here's a good example from last week  HP Inc NYSE HPQ stock price gapped up 18.6 after Warren Buffett revealed that Berkshire Hathaway had acquired 121 million shares.  This lead to this early jump in price  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps99ec8ea9b665f008f2a57cbfc85a9183636d0cec     You can use sites such as barchart.com to run gap up and gap down stock analysis to identify potential targets for profits out of the gates on markets open.  More often that not a gapup will encourage a 'buy' and gapdown will encourage a 'sell'.  However you need to gauge the momentum behind the stock and trend to decide what is the appropriate strategy to deploy however as a simple start point gap circumstances can roughly be categorised as such  1. A breakaway gap Sell short and place a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. 2. An exhaustion gap  prices pull back into it the next day The downtrend is over Cover shorts immediately. 3. Another exhaustion gap marked by a lack of new highs after the gap Several days of churning offer good shorting opportunities with a stop above the high. 4. A continuation gap in a downtrend Go short with a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. Prices hit that stop a few days later  no method is failsafe. 5. An exhaustion gap closed two days after it opened Cover shorts immediately. 6. A common gap in the midst of a congestion area closed the next day No action recommended. 7. A breakaway gap Go long and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. 8. A continuation gap Add to longs and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. The gap at the right edge of the chart could be either a continuation or an exhaustion gap. Relatively quiet volume suggests continuation. If you buy place a protective stop a few ticks below the lower rim of this gap.  In the HP example above this was a breakaway gap with sufficient indicator and fundamental analysis to tell you this was a 'BUY'.  In any case a good solid strategy to nail down and add to the arsenal.,neutral
This guy wont take delivery of his egg future contracts. What to do shitpost,So I've done some work for the poultry industry in the past.  Because of the bird flu scare they wanted to unload a ton of eggs quickly at cut rate costs.  They reached out to me because they know I am on WSB and do some day trading.  I saw this opportunity and agreed to sell some futures contracts.  I ended up selling the agreed upon allotment of DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures.  Turns out I probably could have sold those contracts for way more than I did but we farmers and I wanted to make sure the eggs would move before they went bad.  I only took a 5 cut and the rest goes to the farmers so every contract sold did ok.  If we held out a little longer we could've cleared at least another 20 or more.  Needless to say the farmers have had to massacre their chicken stocks because of the bird flu.  So this one guy that we sold some contracts to wanted more.  Despite being over capacity the farmers wanted to sell more to make up for the fact they were making less per egg.  The farmers coop accepted his contract offers and we'd make more eggs.  This meant all of us myself the farmers and their kids etc. would have to put in the OT to make sure we filled this order.       Now the buyer of the contracts is saying he was messed up when he bought the contracts and cant take physical delivery of the final 10 contracts because of the size of his storage location.  A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs.  A tonne of eggs is anywhere between 1086 and 1736 dozens of eggs.  In total we are talking about over 1 million eggs.  How do you buy a contract and not know that you do not have appropriate storage let alone 10 contracts  Also for reference a chicken will lay one egg per day if youre lucky.  To fill this over sized order we were sitting there jacking off roosters for a week straight to get all of the chicken jizz and then had to finger every hen to knock them up to get the eggs made.  If you turn on a black light in my place you'd go blind and I have a few roosters following me around and sending me chocolates and flowers.     What should I do  I need this guy to take the damn eggs.,negative
NOK to the moon,I had a dream last night that I was explaining my online trading account to my brother. Everything was in the red so it was pretty realistic and I started scrolling down my portfollio showing him some of the stocks I own.  I then got to NOK. And as we looked at it it went up to $20. I said that's unusual for a stock to go up that much in just a short time and no sooner had the words left my mouth did it go to $40. And then I got interested and it went to $80. So I was buying like a fucking tramp on chips and it went all the way to $254. Stayed around the $250 mark for a couple of minutes and then went back down to about $116 before eventually going all the way back to the start I obviously did not sell in time.  Anyway. I'm not sure of the exact time this took place so I've gone and bought shares off the back of it  937  5.33  Admittedly this isn't the best DD you'll ever read. Equally though it's not the worst.

$SPY  Predictions for the week of 411,Last week I said that SPY was going to slope down with nothing crazy that happened except my 5 day forecast got inversed.  The days that I thought would be bearish were actually bullish.    I was thinking about this and noticed how there is hundreds of ways the week could play out  that would result in SPY going down.    I am still going to continue the 5 Day Outlook because it is something funny to do just take it with a grain of salt because it is seriously impossible to predict every single day before the futures market even opens... I write these Saturday morning.    ampx200B  1 Day Chartformatpngampautowebpamps27e05d57d4deb60529bae70e73e6937f820f3fa2  The main levels have been the same for about a month now  Support 432  Resistance 452  The RSI is showing the K approaching an oversold reading there will at least be a short term relief in the selling pressure overall  1 Day Chartformatpngampautowebpamps590c166936580732ddbcfe55540e897b0827817c  I would classify the bollinger band with as a somewhat mean reverting indicator to get a sense of the overall volatility.  Since the bollinger bands have a relative wide span we can assume that we will likely be entering a phase of lower volatility.    ampx200B  CPI Data Release Dateformatpngampautowebpamps5317e8515c102614e5d3e4562d01e737d38e4a72  Everyone is going to be watching the CPI data when it is released on Tuesday.

All retail investors will be watching and all of Wall Street will be watching.  This is not going to be pretty...

There is nothing to be done now I am just waiting.  I still have a lot of positions open when this crash starts I will start to liquidate everything... believe me it will be very noticeable when it starts.   ampx200B  Federal Reserve FOMC statementformatpngampautowebpamps12b1e18659efc463475d55f038f17d0baf6db894  Bullard is concerned for the economy and wants at least a 50 to 75bp rate hike.  I actually found this kind of interesting because he is one of the least corrupt people in office.  He has a net worth around 5 million which is surprisingly low for having inside information.  He also has never worked with big banks and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.  He definitely knows what is going on and what needs to be done to save the economy.  The federal reserve will eventually have to become more aggressive in rate hikes.  ampx200B  Crude Oil CFDsformatpngampautowebpampsd943fa66e23d9a16dc6745f34c4e1246e88f48dd  Predictions  Tuesday is going to be an extremely important day.  I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10.  Oil rose 35 in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5 which is going to shock the markets.    Another factor is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.    The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.  I hate to be that person but over the last year with unemployment decreasing spending increasing and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80 without interfering.  At most there will be a 50 bear market similar to 2008.  The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell then it should recover in the following days.    Not professional financial advice do not solely make your trades based on my opinions I encourage everyone to research more   TLDR  formatpngampautowebpamps39172bb2a032402fe4c78d52443440fff4a1a227  I will respond to every comment,neutral
Calling all dividend investors  Stop making investment decisions based on high dividend yields A good chunk of them are whats called a yield trap Only relying on dividend yield percentage is a good way to get a dividend cut,Calling all dividend investors   Stop making investment decisions based on high dividend yields   A good chunk of them are what's called a yield trap  Only relying on dividend yield percentage is a good way to get a dividend cut.  Few people realize this until the dividend gets cut and it's too late.  I look for businesses that will continue to pay dividends raise those dividends higher than inflation and they have growth divers that will increase their share price.  Stay away from high dividend yields.   gt Find out why the company has such a high dividend yield before considering it.   gt Yields that appear unrealistically high often end up being suspended or cut leaving investors who bought the stock just for the dividend disappointed.,negative

GOGO is Going to GOGO to the Moon  SampP SmallCap 600 Index Inclusion Will Squeeze the Near 40 Float Shorted Stock,We're Going to GOGO to the Moon  GOGO which is based in Chicago is an inflight internet company that provides broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market.  GOGO is currently working on launching Gogo5G which will deliver 25 Mbps on average with peak speeds in the 7580 Mbps range.  The Why  GOGO is one of the highest shorted stocks with 37.15 of the float sold short. Now you may wonder why this is relevant well it's because GOGO is looking to break through the $20 resistance where it can move up without much technical resistance and it has all the right factors going for it.  The How  GOGO is already up 87 this year and the shorts have been suffering heavily. This is the perfect moment for their positions to collapse. As the shorts will already be looking to derisk in the current market environment it gives the stock an even bigger momentum push.  Speaking about the market GOGO has been going up against it and is green during red days. It's showing what we like to call regard strength.  The Fundamental amp Technical  1. It was recently added to the SampP SmallCap 600 Index so the passive investors are all buying. This is supported by the fact that volume has exploded since. 2. Traders are buying in due to momentum and the high short percentage. Supported by the chart and volume as well. 3. It's currently testing levels not seen since 2015.  The Hypothesis  In my opinion $40 is easily achievable in the short term under the current dynamics and the fundamentalstechnicals. The chart looks like it is ready for a parabolic move.  The Position  GOGO 5202022 $20.00 CALL. Still cheap due to low IV and gives me a month for the breakout to occur. Any positive market day could cause it. it's also pumping today during a fear day which is a great sign.  TLDR GOGO recently added to SampP SmallCap 600 Index momentum is going to cause covering by the high short percentage.  Ape TLDR GOGO TO THE MOON,positive

Making Bank Using Leverage and Options I promise its not as bad as it sounds, If You Had To Point Out The Flaws Of The Stock Market Relative To Other Asset Classes What Would They Be  Theres a long list of them high volatility sequence of return risk low cashflow high efficiency and liquidity this could be a pro or con depending on how you look at it lack of significant leverage etc.  Out of all those things however were gonna focus on two of them. The lack of cashflow and the lack of leverage. Both of these things are abundant in real estate in particular. A good rental multifamily can be expected to have a cap rate of 712 with a cash on cash return ideally around 15 or higher. This is because 1 real estate does not rely upon appreciation solely it relies upon the income it generates from the renters and 2 investment properties typically only need a 20 down payment in order to purchase.  Thats a 51 leverage ratio which would be impossible to achieve safely in the stock market.  Now it used to be that stocks had lower appreciation and higher dividend yields however that has not been the case for 70 years at least.  You can take a look at this dividend yield chart of the SampP 500 for reference.  formatpngampautowebpampsc4d2968767da41b9c7914a3b2fb641edbc6d10de   Luckily We Can Turn The Stock Market Back Into An Income Machine Using Options  This is the whole premise of the thetagang position. We replace our stock appreciation with premiums received from selling options as a sort of dividend yield.  So we turn to selling puts and calls on SPX or SPY or whatever index you prefer. Thats great but if we compare it back to real estate were still missing the essential component of leverage.  Thats where leveraged ETFs come in.  The pros and cons of LEFTs have been hotly debated but what settled it for me personally was this post by hedgefundie and this article about volatility decay If you don't want to read through all of that I've condensed down the important stuff regarding volatility decay and proper diversification in this postswamputm_campaignpostamputm_mediumweb. But basically assuming it works perhaps we can change it from capital appreciation to income generation using options.  Surely that should work right  Well it should if we do it correctly to avoid assignment as much as possible.  Leveraged ETFs suffer from something called volatility decay basically just describing the idea that a when a loss is incurred a greater gain needs to be made to square ourselves back to zero. With leverage we magnify our risk to this factor.  So because we have more vulnerability to downside lets protect ourselves using a bit of probability.   Using Standard Deviation To Calculate Probabilities  Lets just assume for the moment that all market movements are as good as being random. Yes they are based on data but if we dont have access to said data the movements may as well be random.  Under this assumption we can then also assume that there are probabilities to which direction a stock is going to move. There should be roughly a 50 chance that the stock will go up or down at any given moment.  On top of that we could also assume that larger movements are less likely than smaller movements mainly due to the fact that it takes much larger sudden inflows and outflows of cash to make a stock behave that way. Now some stocks have a relatively higher ability to make a significant move in either direction but even these stocks still have boundaries where they will be unlikely to move.  A good example of this how wild Teslas swings are relative to General Electric. Tesla has a higher relative swing compared to General Electric but even Tesla is unlikely to swing to $30 or $5000 in the next year.  Now these observations we just made are the fundamental ideas behind the concept of standard deviation.  Standard deviation essentially says that within a given time frame usually a year a stock has a certain probability of being within certain price ranges based on its volatility its ability to make wild swings like Tesla.  formatpngampautowebpampsad20b147792f9eb6d33617c18bd6d4722b526bc9  As you can see at the bottom of the chart we see that at each increasing or decreasing standard deviation 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 etc there is less of a probability that our data or in this case the stock price will fall into this range given a normal distribution.  If you add up all the percentages between 1 and 1 we get a 68.2 chance that our stock price will fall in this range. This is called the first standard deviation. If we expand out the 2 and 2 then we get a 95.4 chance that our stock price will fall within the range. That is called the second standard deviation. If we go out to the 3 on each side we get a 98.8 chance that the stock price will fall within the range. With each standard deviation the chance that a stock price will fall within the range gets higher albeit at a much slower rate.   So What Does This Have To Do With Selling Options  Using these standard deviations we can get probabilities that a stock will fall within a certain range. If we use something called Implied Volatility we can figure out what the market thinks that one standard deviation is. Then using that we can predict what probability our option has of expiring in the money which is what we dont want.  To find implied volatility we can go to a website like volafy.net and get the implied volatility percentage. In the case of TQQQ QQQ leveraged 3x the implied volatility is 80 at this time of writing.  Using this percentage we can plug it into a handy formula to calculate the standard deviation for any specific option.  The formula looks like this  sqrtoption days until expiration365  implied volatility  current stock price  In written terms basically we divide the days until expiration by 365 then take the square root of that and multiply it by the implied volatility percentage and the current stock price.  That gives us the amount in dollars of the first standard deviation. If you take that amount and add it AND subtract it from the current price it will give you the range the stock will fall within 68 of the time.  Right now we are interested in selling puts on TQQQ without getting exercised so well sell at one standard deviation out of the money. At the current price of TQQQ $51.84 the first standard deviation out of the money would be $38.11 which is also 51.84  13.73.  If we go back up to our standard deviation chart we can see that on the left side of the chart the side that represents our OTM options we can add up all the percentages before the 1st standard deviation mark. This comes out to be a 15.9 that our OTM option will become ITM by expiration you might have noticed that this percentage closely correlates with the delta of the option which is a good way to gauge it as well. If we are selling monthly options this comes out to be getting assigned once out of every six months on average. To me those seem like pretty good odds.  So lets go down to the $38 strike put on TQQQ which is trading $128 per contract right now. Thats a 3.37 ROI in 40 days or 30.75 annually.  If we assume assignment three times a year that wipes out any premiums made for that given month we are still sitting on a 20.64 CAGR.   But Wait Isnt This Riskier Than Selling Puts On Regular Old QQQ  This is the beauty of it you have the same risk of getting assigned on TQQQ as you do with QQQ if you stay at the same standard deviation but still receive 3x the premium. This is because with TQQQ higher volatility we sell further OTM than we would with regular QQQ but still receive the high premiums due to it being a leveraged product.  If you do happen to get assigned no worries Personally I would recommend that you simply just sell out of the position at the current price and open a new put for the next month. The reason why I say this as opposed to selling a call is that calls do not have the same volatility risk premium that puts do and therefore do not sell for as much. If you want to read more there is this paperreprep1amptypepdf which discusses the outperformance of a put writing only strategy that outperforms during bearflat markets. If you open a new put you are simply taking the loss for that month with the intention that the high win rate probability of this trading strategy will make you square again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS STRATEGY ON ANYTHING BESIDES INDEXES if you do chances are that eventually that stock will get wiped out and never recover I'm looking at you TLRY. Indexes on the other hand do recover you don't need to look any further than this chart to prove it.

This guy wont take delivery of his egg future contracts. What to do shitpost,So I've done some work for the poultry industry in the past.  Because of the bird flu scare they wanted to unload a ton of eggs quickly at cut rate costs.  They reached out to me because they know I am on WSB and do some day trading.  I saw this opportunity and agreed to sell some futures contracts.  I ended up selling the agreed upon allotment of DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures.  Turns out I probably could have sold those contracts for way more than I did but we farmers and I wanted to make sure the eggs would move before they went bad.  I only took a 5 cut and the rest goes to the farmers so every contract sold did ok.  If we held out a little longer we could've cleared at least another 20 or more.  Needless to say the farmers have had to massacre their chicken stocks because of the bird flu.  So this one guy that we sold some contracts to wanted more.  Despite being over capacity the farmers wanted to sell more to make up for the fact they were making less per egg.  The farmers coop accepted his contract offers and we'd make more eggs.  This meant all of us myself the farmers and their kids etc. would have to put in the OT to make sure we filled this order.       Now the buyer of the contracts is saying he was messed up when he bought the contracts and cant take physical delivery of the final 10 contracts because of the size of his storage location.  A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs.  A tonne of eggs is anywhere between 1086 and 1736 dozens of eggs.  In total we are talking about over 1 million eggs.  How do you buy a contract and not know that you do not have appropriate storage let alone 10 contracts  Also for reference a chicken will lay one egg per day if youre lucky.  To fill this over sized order we were sitting there jacking off roosters for a week straight to get all of the chicken jizz and then had to finger every hen to knock them up to get the eggs made.  If you turn on a black light in my place you'd go blind and I have a few roosters following me around and sending me chocolates and flowers.     What should I do  I need this guy to take the damn eggs.,negative

Musk hints at Tesla's Lithium mining entry...two years after it already allegedly entered the market,  For those who don't remember two years ago Musk and Tesla announced his easy it was to extract lithium from clay and salt and a revolutionary new process at its 2020 battery day.  Allegedly 10000 acres of property rights in Nevada were bought noone has ever seen public land registry relating.  Even though Geochemists from established Lithium miners were unable to perform such alchemy Musk was going to of course.  Yet here we are again with Musk talking up Tesla's entry into Lithium mining.  At least it seems some in the media are finally at least keeping track of the embellishments and hype if not directly daring to cite the BS.  Anyone who has actually done a little homework on Lithium mining will know contrary to popular media reports that many far better informed Geochemists have tried and failed similar techniques that Musk is citing as far back as the 1920's.  To get the salt to react with the lithium silicates requires heating it to 1000 degrees centigrade.  The energy required makes it ridiculously uneconomical versus traditional brine extraction processes.  The Pied Piper continues to play his tunes.,negative
 Can I refuse delivery on 50 tons of Egg futures ,So I went a bit overboard with DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures. I took a bunch of drugs and my friend had a bird and idk why but it made me think a Bird flu strain coming this year so I got a shit ton of contracts.   Turns out I hit the lottery as farmers across the nation massacred their chicken stocks cuz of bird flu. I got in at about 3750 a contract and cashed out at 4400.   I apparently did not get all of my Contracts out and now I have people contacting me saying I need to take physical delivery of 10 contracts. A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs  I live in an apartment I cannot take delivery of 50 tons of eggs What do I do I made a killing so I can hire whoever I need to to make this go away but can someone help me I do not want 50 tons of eggs coming to my door.  Would it be illegal for me to list delivery address as the nearest federal reserve building  For referenceperspective there are between approx 1174 and 2381 DOZEN eggs in a single ton. This puts me at approx 720000  1.2 million eggs. I am really Stressing out over the logistics of how the fuck Id ship out this amount of eggs to shelters. It would have to be SO many shelters.

DD short future contracts on eggs,I believe there is artificial demand for eggs currently because of some bird flu outbreak that was temporarily pumping the price of eggs. This coupled with unusual future buying has caused the price of eggs to be much higher than it should be.  I believe there is an estimated float of 50 tons of eggs that have yet to be delivered or sold. Once these eggs are delivered the price of egg futures should tank as this will lead to a surplus of egg commodities on the market with low buyers.  I would even be confident that this 50 ton egg order isnt even going into the egg market. Which means this egg order will probably be repod or just completely lost to churn. If this happens the future price of eggs will crash because 50 tons were delivered but not sold on the commodity market. This leads farmers to believe this elevated demand for eggs will continue causing oversupply and supply shocks decreasing price despite bird flu worries.  I cant explain where Ive heard this figure of 50 tons of eggs being purchased in the market but not used in the commodity market but I assure you short future contracts will print once this order gets essentially wasted.,negative
Having fought this battle for decades I am pleased that the House of Representatives has done its job and set the table for success in the Senate and ultimately for the American people.,Having fought this battle for decades I am pleased that the House of Representatives has done its job and set the table for success in the Senate and ultimately for the American people.  By Rep. Earl Blumenauer DOR  After working on cannabis reform for decades we hit another critical threshold Congress passed both the comprehensive MORE Act which is the gold standard in cannabis reform and my Medical Marijuana Research Act.    Make no mistake. The reason we are at this moment and poised to end the tragic unfair and misguided prohibition on cannabis is because the people got there first. Thirtyeight states have enacted medical marijuana and 18 states have determined that adult use should be legal. In total 98 percent of the population has access to some form of legalized cannabis because at the state level the fact that over twothirds of the public favor full legalization matters. While the federal government isnt there yet that too is changing.  The Senate can put these pieces inline with each other  banking comprehensive reform and research.,positive
Short Strangle Wheel option strategy idea,   tldr  Wheel but you also have 100 shares of the underlying and sell Covered calls along with the Cash secured puts.  So there are many ways to describe this strategy and I don't know if others have already come up with it they probably have but I wanted to know your guys opinion on it and what you think some issues might be. It is essentially a short strangle but you own shares of the underlying and wheel it. So with the usual wheel strategy you sell cash secured puts and generate premium from that and then when assigned sell covered calls above the basis you got assigned on the puts and if its a bullish stock it will eventually pay out. This strategy works similarly except you buy 100 shares of the underlying and sell both OTM calls and OTM puts This way you can profit if the stocks go up or stays even. If you get assigned on your call its above what you bought the shares for so you make profit along with the puts you sold that expire worthless. If the stock stays between the 2 strikes it will act similarly to a iron condor and you just get to keep the premium. If you get assigned on the puts you just buy more shares of the underlying which dollar cost averages your initial shares meaning you can sell more covered calls at a lower basis to breakeven and make profit. Essentially its the wheel but you benefit if the stock stays the same and goes up but if the stock goes down it just DCAs your shares. As long as its a bullish stock and you have enough capital you can just keep dollar cost averaging your way down and the stock would have to rebound a minimal amount for you to still make profit on the shares and you keep all the premium you farmed a long the way from either side. I'm sure there is probably something I have forgotten about or not taken account so please leave your thoughts in the comments.,neutral

Walmart DD,Attention retards   Walmart is undervalued. Yes I know its at an all time high. Yes it's still undervalued.   It's chief competition Amazon is experiencing unionization and increasingly poor reputation for quality control of its vendors. It shouldn't take a phD in statistics to divinate which products are scams and which are real but its getting that way and my brain is too smooth for that shit. Walmart's online retail business is growing steadily and will continue to regain share from Amazon.   Stagflation and skyrocketing food prices will further drive sales.

Inflation is done....kinda,The Fed controls the supply of money.  Supply and demand determines value.  Just like oil when a lot of supply goes into the market the value of oil goes down.  Same thing with money.    We do not have a demand issue.  The base economy fuckin sucks.  We have a supply issue where the Fed supplied so much money into the market they reduced the value of money and caused inflation.  Well now it's the opposite.  They will be taking out excess supply making the value of money go up to reverse the effects of inflation.  BUT they will cause a recession that may already be here.   The main component of an economy is consumer spending.  Investment government spending and net exports are the others.  Inflation is already affecting consumer spending which affects demand which eventually affects employment.  The Fed will tame inflation by removing money supply and likely overtame inflation causing a recession.  As debt service costs go up consumer demand will decrease and corporations will look to lay off people.   We are starting a nasty cycle....that will essentially lead to little or no growth for the next 5 to 10 years.   The Fed will again take too long to reverse the inflation taming.  But the problem is that we don't actually have a demand driven inflation with a robust economy...so what is the end result going to be  Deflation.    How long for I got no fuckin idea.  So we will start a deflationary process in the next 618 months and the only option will be 0 and printing money again.   Expect that within 24 months the printer goes brr again.  Yes...no one has said this yet but the Fed may cause a deflationary spiral especially if they don't act properly.

China binds Russian business. Entrepreneurs are switching to the yuan,As stated by money.pl   gt Sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine are pushing Russia into the orbit of Chinese influence.  Economic cooperation is tightening but Beijing plays a dominant role in this arrangement.  Dreams of a big ruble are falling aside.  Russian business is already switching to yuan billing and the Chinese are buying Russian oil and coal for their currency  gt Although Vladimir Putin dreamed of a petrublel and settlements with the West in the Russian currency the economic reality reveals this dream.  It is not the ruble but the yuan that has a much greater influence in the region and with each day of sanctions China's position will strengthen drawing Russia into an orbit of dependence and influence.  gt Russian banks have already recorded a sharp increase in the number of accounts in yuan writes Rzeczpospolita and explains that the transition to the yuan has become necessary for Russian business because of the sanctions.  gt This tendency is confirmed by a poll of the Kommersant newspaper quoted by Rzeczpospolita.  Since the beginning of the year the amount of funds in accounts in Chinese currency has increased approximately eightfold at Tinkoff Bank and fourfold at MTS Bank and Uralski Bank for Reconstruction and Development UBRD.  The same is happening at the St. Petersburg Bank where the number of these business accounts has almost 3.5fold and the number of contracts in Chinese currency has doubled.  gt Russian entrepreneurs are forced to trade in yuan.  The domestic currency is unstable and Western sanctions and Putin's decrees such as the one of March 5 prohibiting the repayment of liabilities to entities from the list of hostile countries in Western currencies make it difficult for entrepreneurs to do business with contractors abroad.  gt   China also has ambitions  at least in Asia  to dominate trade in its currency.  If you add to this the fact that the sanctions throw Moscow into the arms of Beijing's dependence the yuan will rather have a dominant role  confirmed in an interview with money.pl prof.  Dariusz Filar.  gt As Rzeczpospolita points out more Russian companies are betting on the yuan.  Among them are companies trading in spare parts textiles and food products.  The oil steel and mining industries are also starting to deal in Chinese currency.  According to the daily private Chinese companies are buying oil and coal from Russia for delivery in May and June.  gt Russia is falling more and more into the orbit of Chinese interests.  As we wrote in money.pl China is Russia's largest trading partner and although bilateral trade reached a new record of $ 147 billion last year these relations are very asymmetrical.  gt The strategic partnership between Russia and China brings more benefits to the Middle Kingdom than to Russia.  Russia is only the 15th export partner of the PRC.  In addition China has overtaken Russia in terms of trade with most Central Asian countries.  gt The situation is similar in the energy sector especially in the gas sector.  In 2014 after Russia's military intervention in Crimea when Russia received further economic sanctions from the European Union and was isolated in the West China after ten long years of negotiations suddenly decided to conclude a gas contract with it forcing the Kremlin to accept a low  delivery prices.

See previous DD  Most technical analysis techniques look at historical prices to divine future prices. This technical analysis focuses instead on the current Option Open Interest. In other words my crayons taste different.  Whenever the stock price blue touches the delta neutral line green and crosses back up it tends to go another 58.  I developed a tool which uses the entire open interest to calculate three important numbers  Delta Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option delta is 0.  Gamma Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is 0.  Gamma Maximum  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is the maximum.  The theory behind it is simple enough institutions tend to be the largest holders of short options contracts and are therefore obligated to hedge against those options contracts while collecting juicy premium riskfree.  By calculating similar numbers to what these institutions are dependent on I'm hoping to ride their coattails and earn tendies from their rounding errors.

You think youre making random deposits into your bank account but you dont notice that you keep using your favorite number in the amount over and over again.

Twitter is The Hindenburg  Elon is the Flame  You have not been paying close attention,Updatefollow up . There is no hostile takeover _is_doomed_there_is_no_hostile_takeover   Not financial advice Manage risk  I'm going to walk you through very methodically why Twitter is doomed and why Elon can't and won't save it with heavy DD. If anything he's a major catalyst to accelerate this process so I've taken the time to explain it here. I've categorized each section incase your brain is too smooth to understand one of the sections like the profit margins etc.  Also Elon's  Tweets today are ... well just look for yourself..   I keep getting comments about this  Twitter is already dead the institutions holding twitter hold it for heavy influence of the consumers. That stock and its financials don't mean much to them other than this. IMHOnfa  Gonna post this again at the top  gtTwitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules the company said in an unattributed statement. Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions. As always the statement added our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service. Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.  Yes I know it's a lie connect the dots it's easy.  ampx200B   Quick Recap Since April Fool's Day  ampx200B  Let's start here since this is undoubtedly where most of the smooth brains heard about this.  Elon took a 9.2 stake in twitter as reported  Mon Apr 4. while most of you were sleeping at 3 in the morning the stock gapped up 27 via 13G filing which is required for anyone who purchases more than 5 of a company. This publicly and officially discloses big ownership stakes.  When smooth brains heard this they thought 'wow Elon musk is in must be going to the moon' so they bought the top and pushed it up another few percent some smooth brains got out for tiny profit. Others got dumped on and got left holding the bag or sold for a loss because there was zero conviction or research into this play other than such stake much wow.  Some geniuses in this sub predicted it perfectly down to the timeline and price action how it would get dumped. Major congrats to you to being well versed in retard timelines and I hope you are still holding those puts because we've got a lot further to go down imo  ampx200B   Wendy's Laws of Tendies Applies  ampx200B  Should of simply applied  _wendys_laws_of_tendies  gt1st Law of Wendy's Mass stupidity. Assume everyone and you is retarded. The sooner you understand we are all natural born crayon eaters the sooner you are on the path to tendieland. Never trust anyone or yourself at first. If something seems retarded to you at first it's probably genius. The inverse is also true if you or others think it's genius at first glance it's probably retarded. Same thing if you see other people saying that. I don't care who they are. Do more research into it. Figure out how retarded everyone is so you can replace those crayon dinners with chicken feasts.  Now it's time to go one step further and apply  gt2nd Law of Wendy's Confusion. The more confusing and convoluted the information is the likelier it is you'll make big tendies. Big words and vocabulary you don't really understand means it's above your paygrade and therefore likely the opposite of retarded. Learn more about it and see if it's worth buying.   What Can Or Will Elon Do And What Can't or Won't He Do  ampx200B  I've seen a lot of next level retarded shit about Elon saving Twitter all over the internet.  Let's lay out the facts  1. Twitter is 77 owned by institutions  2. Elon is the 'single largest holder' but that doesn't mean much since you need 50.1  of a company to 'control it' 3. You cannot do a hostile take over of Twitter because of who owns it. 4. Twitter's Board in a statement put this out yes I know it's a lie they can control it point is they are not going to and they aren't there to make money directly off of TWTR  ampx200B  formatpjpgampautowebpamps52eb68361bde139f763d168655f4c0fe89d3766c  Meaning Twitter stock is worthless since the employees run the company and Elon doesn't get to decide shit. Same ownership. Same Management.  5. The CEO and the rest of the company doesn't believe in this stuff  gtParag Agrawal Our role is not to  be bound by the First Amendment but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation and our moves are reflective of things that we believe lead to a healthier public conversation. The kinds of things that we do to work about this is to focus less on thinking about free speech but thinking about how the times have changed. One of the changes today that we see is speech is easy on the internet. Most people can speak but our role which is particularly emphasized is who can be heard.  6. Elon is also capped at 14.8 ownership being a board member. But it doesn't matter because the 77 of the other institutions are not giving up their stakes. I'll get into that more later  Now that we laid out some facts lets talk about some implications of this  Elon cannot and will not change twitter in any meaningful way the company does not care about the share holders or even making money. They care about their activism. Ownership is onboard with this and is going to subsidize  like CNN etc. and continue running it in the direction that it has been going in. And even if they didn't a lot of the population will not ever trust TWTR again and a lot of the population esp on Twitter does not like Elon at all. Just look into that yourself if you don't believe me I know it's hard to believe  ampx200B   So what is the current direction of Twitter  Twitter is going down the tubes for a number of very important reasons.  ampx200B   Lets look at the financials and KPIs  First let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet  Starting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 _financials2020arFiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf  We can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue  1.37B Cost revenue  873M in 'Research and development'  888M in 'Sales and marketing'  562M in 'general and administrative'  Twitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.  Let's break this down again  Twitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent  37 on cost of revenue servers buildings upkeep etc.  23 on Research and development software engineers sociologists artists focus groups market research I believe moderators is in here as well  24 on Sales and marketing sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.  15 of general and administrative executives legal finance info tech hr consulting moderators in both categories probably customer service etc.  3 on interest and other interest on debt financing operations etc.  29 on taxes.  Yes these numbers add to 131 of revenue or in other words a 31 net income loss.  Why is Twitter so expensive to run why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money  Lets go back in time to Twitter in 20112013  Here's the same report from that time period. _financialsarTwitterInc2013AnnualReport.pdf  Page 57  Going to compare to Twitters Monthly active users MAU textAs20of20the20first20quarterdaily20active20users20mDAUdaily20active20users20mDAU.  2013 225M monthly active users MAU  Cost of Revenue  266 M 330M inflation adjusted  Research and Development.RampD 593M 740M inflation adjustedSales and Marketing 316M 400M inflation adjustedGeneral and Administrative 124M 160M inflation adjusted  2011 100M MAU  Cost of Revenue 62M 85M inflation adjusted  RampD 80M 110M inflation adjusted  Sales and marketing 26M 36M inflation adjusted  General and administrative 233M 310M inflation adjusted  Ok so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users  2020 330M MAU  Cost of revenue $4.15 per monthly active user  RampD $2.65 per monthly active user  Sales and marketing $2.7 per monthly active user  General and admin $1.7 per monthly active user  2013 225M monthly active users MAU numbers below adjusted for inflation  Cost of revenue $1.47 per monthly active user  RampD $3.29 per monthly active user  Sales and marketing $1.78 per monthly active user  General and admin $0.71 per monthly active user  2011 100M monthly active users MAU numbers below adjusted for inflation  Cost of revenue $0.85 per monthly active user  RampD $1.10 per monthly active user  Sales and marketing $0.36 per monthly active user  General and admin $0.85 per monthly active user  So what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.  Let's recap  Cost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15user in 2020 inflation adjusted 388 increase  RampD went from $1.10user in 2011 to $2.65user in 2020 inflation adjusted 141 increase  Sales and marketing went from $0.36user in 2011 to $2.70user in 2020 inflation adjusted 650 increase  And general and admin from $0.85user in 2011 to $1.70user in 2020 inflation adjusted 100 increase  As you can see twitter suffers from huge inflated costs over the years of running their business.  I suspect this has a lot to do with financing of their servers through amortization payments.  But also trying to scale their business with the technology that was available 10 years ago and not being able to change their business model because it was bad PR to fire off thousands people and replace them with future technology they've essentially been forced to grow with their existing business modeling scaling up which you can see results in worse and eventually negative margins.  Twitter has 5500 employees 1 employee for every 60000 users  This is one of the things they fear more is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare. by their other competitors I won't mention here just yet  Facebook has all of these similar issues with growing costs and declining growth etc.  More sources  Twitters growth is slowing and stagnant   As is their profitability    And ARPUActivity Engagement  14B in Total Assets  6.7B in Total Liabilities  Net income is negative and historical trends are horrible    FCF does not look great either  Also considering censorship is Twitters product what userbase is left after that . Besides they never did anything wrong why admit that now to change it if profit is not a motive  All down the tubes. Ownership does not care employees do not care. Twitter is not about making money to them and it never will be imo  ampx200B   Why is Elon there then He's not stupid  ampx200B  You are completely right about Elon. But understand that Elon's net worth is near 300B and this is a troll purchase to him. Advertisement for his products and entertainment. He knows exactly what he is doing. The employees there are already revolting  Get it  ampx200B  formatpjpgampautowebpampsf4178e80678e2d341f15ea439afb97507ff08246  ampx200B  Twitter is taking since last year to roll out a simple edit button  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampsb8d15d2926b42a79df9ab6c17809e0416998a56e  ampx200B   TLDR  ampx200B  Twitter r Fuk. 1st and 2nd Law of Wendy's applies here. Elon can't and wont be saving shit even if he wants to I've got even more DD about that and Twitters competitors but I won't mention it here for now  Even if it does change the userbase and employees will revolt even more than they already are.

The force of retard is strong in retail in this one. I've seen smoothers say TWTR is the next amazon and that Elon is doing a hostile takeover.  Also Institutional money has a lot vested to prop them up.  Good luck  gt3rd Law of Wendy's Diamond Hands. If you're betting around short term small movement you're going to paper hand or miss out. The best things can be volatile or daunting before doing the research. The payout has to be worth the risk otherwise you'll lose out over time even if you win more often.

Calling all dividend investors  Stop making investment decisions based on high dividend yields A good chunk of them are whats called a yield trap Only relying on dividend yield percentage is a good way to get a dividend cut,Calling all dividend investors   Stop making investment decisions based on high dividend yields   A good chunk of them are what's called a yield trap  Only relying on dividend yield percentage is a good way to get a dividend cut.  Few people realize this until the dividend gets cut and it's too late.  I look for businesses that will continue to pay dividends raise those dividends higher than inflation and they have growth divers that will increase their share price.  Stay away from high dividend yields.   gt Find out why the company has such a high dividend yield before considering it.   gt Yields that appear unrealistically high often end up being suspended or cut leaving investors who bought the stock just for the dividend disappointed.,negative

Continue to accumulate $PAA units or open the $12$17 January 2024 Call Spread,Below my comments lies a quote from an SA article today written by Samuel Smith. It independently confirms my previous posts for those that were hesitant.  This is not an overnight  to the moon.   This will be a gradual climb but well worth the wait.  For those interested my top 7 holdings are as follows  1 $PAA  2 $ET  3 $NCLH until $25 then Ill sellthats post dilution fair value in my opinion 4 $C  5 $T received WBD shares today 6 $DIS 7 $VSCO  Other positions include $LEVI $VFH $KTB $EAT $VFC $FL these are all very undervalued cash flow amp sales growth positive companies.  While I dont have positions yet I dont hate $FB or $PYPL here.    1. Plains All American Pipeline NASDAQPAA  PAA's strength lies in its welllocated midstream energy infrastructure in the lowestcost U.S. shale basin Permian Basin. In fact it has such substantial scale and strategic positioning in the Permian Basin that Morningstar speculates that  It's not much of a stretch to state that there is a high probability that in some fashion Plains touches every barrel of oil the Permian produces earning a fee if not multiple fees.  While weakness in volumes from the basin relative to supply of infrastructure has led to poor financial results for PAA in recent years demand is beginning to recover in the basin and we expect PAA to be a big beneficiary of this trend.   Wall Street analysts seems to agree with consensus estimates for distributable cash per unit expected to improve at a 7.9 CAGR over the next half decade despite growth capital expenditures set to decline to a mere $275 million in 2022 down from $950 million in 2020.  Management is allocating the extra free cash flow primarily towards paying down debt in an effort to further strengthen its investment grade standing and set the business up to better weather any future downcycles like it experienced in 2020.  Additionally PAA has been allocating free cash flow towards equity unit repurchases  accelerating its buyback pace in Q4  and is also growing its distribution at a brisk pace just hiked its quarterly distribution by 20.8 in an effort to restore it to its precut level.   With an expected 2022 free cash flow level of $1.3 billion PAA currently offers a mouthwatering 16.5 free cash flow yield that covers its recently increased distribution by more than two times.   This  when combined with expectations of strong perunit distributable cash flow growth over the next half decade  will enable PAA to deleverage grow its distribution and buy back units at a very solid clip and should lead to outsized total returns for unitholders. ,positive
NOK to the moon,I had a dream last night that I was explaining my online trading account to my brother. Everything was in the red so it was pretty realistic and I started scrolling down my portfollio showing him some of the stocks I own.  I then got to NOK. And as we looked at it it went up to $20. I said that's unusual for a stock to go up that much in just a short time and no sooner had the words left my mouth did it go to $40. And then I got interested and it went to $80. So I was buying like a fucking tramp on chips and it went all the way to $254. Stayed around the $250 mark for a couple of minutes and then went back down to about $116 before eventually going all the way back to the start I obviously did not sell in time.  Anyway. I'm not sure of the exact time this took place so I've gone and bought shares off the back of it  937  5.33  Admittedly this isn't the best DD you'll ever read. Equally though it's not the worst.  If you need to tell me this is not financial advice then God help you.,positive
Can Elon Musk purchase another 11 of Twitter in the NEAR future 11  9  Twitter board control pls any SEC rules gurus,This might be a relatively long post but I've been looking at Delaware law and various other information sources related to this entire Elon amp Twitter thing. Some of this post is going to be statements and the rest is questions. I'm really hoping I can find some SEC guru that can point me in the right direction because I have questions but don't know how to google them lol. Sorry if it sounds like I don't really know what I'm talking about because honestly I don't but I would really like some insight from people who do.  ampx200B  This document here was signed by both the CEO of Twitter Parag Agrawal and Elon Musk. It states the following  1. Elon will become a board member. 2. Elon cannot purchase more than 14.9 of Twitter. 3. This document falls under Delaware law.  So my takeaway here is this document holds significance because it limits Elon from acquiring more than 14.9 of Twitter. From here I went to figure out why 14.9 is significant this is what I found.  This document here CTRL  F gt 15 says the following  1.  These provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.  2.  As a Delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law including Section203 of the Delaware General Corporation law which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least twothirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such 15 or greater stockholder.  3. There's a lot more it's just too much to copy paste here.  My takeaway from this is you cannot own 14.9 rule is they're trying to prevent him from pushing for a hostile takeover. My next question was what percentage ownership do you need to force the board to listen to you this is what I found.  This document here CTRL  F gt 20 says the following  1.  4 Control including the terms controlling controlled by and under common control with means the possession directly or indirectly of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person whether through the ownership of voting stock by contract or otherwise. A person who is the owner of 20 or more of the outstanding voting stock of any corporation partnership unincorporated association or other entity shall be presumed to have control of such entity in the absence of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary Notwithstanding the foregoing a presumption of control shall not apply where such person holds voting stock in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this section as an agent bank broker nominee custodian or trustee for 1 or more owners who do not individually or as a group have control of such entity.  2. There's a lot more it's just too much to copy paste here.  My takeaway from this is that if Elon is able to get 20 of Twitter he has control over the board and they need to listen to what he says. Now a recap on what's happened in the recent days.  Elon originally started acquiring Twitter shares starting 1312022 and recently announced his position whether he did this abiding by all of the SEC rules is debatable but not the point. Right after this information came out both the current and previous CEO of Twitter made public posts welcoming Elon to the board and saying he'll be a great addition to the team. However late last night apparently Elon had a change of heart and completely went back on the contract he signed this one from above. This part is speculation but maybe Elon approached the board and said I want changes made to the way you guys handle censorship then they told him no. If Elon backs out of an agreement that basically only says one thing you cannot have more than 14.9 then wouldn't that imply he has intentions of acquiring more than 14.9 And if he's going to go for 14.9 wouldn't he just go for 20 so he has control over the board   There was a tweet Elon made saying something along the lines of expect significant improvements to Twitter in the coming months. In order for someone to make changes to the platform he would need 1 of 2 things or both.  1. A board seat which he declined. 2. 20 ownership.  All signs seem to point towards Elon buying another 11 granting him power over the board forcing them to listen to him.   The questions that I wasn't able to figure out on my own are as follows  1. Are there any SEC rules that prohibit Elon from selling the 9.1 he recently purchased in the near future Wouldn't him selling now be a deliberate pump and dump How would he be punished if he did this He knew that his purchase would increase the stock value it sounds like textbook price manipulation to just flip sides and sell now. 2. Are there any SEC rules that prohibit Elon from purchasing another 11 in the NEAR future. I understand he'll be able to buy more shares going forward now that he's voided the contract he had with Twitter but is there a time limit after just recently buying the 9.1  I tried to find the answers to these questions but I have no idea where to look. Really hoping there's some SEC guru around that can provide some insight here.,negative

I tried to warn about this as soon as I heard the news but WSB didn't let me post because I am so new here. I think this is the last chance to hop on board before it's mooning to euphoric rates.  Norwegian salmon is also a hedge for the looming food crisis. As the lowest carbon emitting source of animal protein Norwegian salmon will cover for shortages in other foods.

Elon is starting to unload his $TWTR position. Time to buy puts.,Ive got $46 weekly Puts  There were two huge sell orders that executed simultaneously today after hours.  Each one for 1105885 shares.  Out of sheer curiuosioty I went through Elons 13D because it listed all of the buy orders hes made since January.

A high utilization means a crowded short right Meaning a bunch of people are shorting a stock.  But why is utilization so low for BBAI Well check out cost to borrow costs. They go as high as 900. That's SST range and that went as high as 37 dollars this past week. Also a locked float situation  Try as an experiment to short a share of BBAI. You won't be able to find a share to short. The stock is that illiquid. That's why I believe once this goes parabolic it's gonna go go.

Make no mistake. The reason we are at this moment and poised to end the tragic unfair and misguided prohibition on cannabis is because the people got there first. Thirtyeight states have enacted medical marijuana and 18 states have determined that adult use should be legal.

"Russian Palladium Refiners banned by London's Platinum and Palladium Market and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange SBSW and other nonRussian Palladium companies stand to gain massively","On Friday the London Platinum and Palladium Market a major trading venue for Palladium and other platinum group metals banned two major Russian state owned Palladium refineries from having their Palladium and Platinum sold on the LPPM's London and Zurich exchanges This was followed up by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also banning the same Russian state owned refiners today Additionally the Japanese Exchange Group's Osaka exchange is now also reviewing whether or not to ban Russian Palladium and Platinum refiners. This has major implications in the Palladium market as Russia produces about 40 of the world's Palladium. Russia's Palladium and Platinum exports were one of the very last major Russian exports left that were not subject to any major sanctions. As civilian deaths mount in the RussoUkrainian War more and more pressure will mount on Western governments and financial regulators to cut Russia further out of the world markets. Any removal of Russian palladium from the world market gives an excellent opportunity for nonRussian Palladium producers to profit. Aside from Russia major palladium mines are located in South Africa the United States and Canada. Palladium is used heavily in both the car industry and electronics industry being used in both catalytic converters and integrated circuits. If major automakers and chip makers are no longer allowed to buy Russian Palladium they will be all forced to compete for Palladium produced by companies like Sibanye Stillwater SBSW which controls nearly all of American Palladium mining production and has major mines in South Africa and Impala Platinum Holdings JSE IMP which has major Canadian and South African mines.

"Short Strangle Wheel option strategy idea","   tldr  Wheel but you also have 100 shares of the underlying and sell Covered calls along with the Cash secured puts.  So there are many ways to describe this strategy and I don't know if others have already come up with it they probably have but I wanted to know your guys opinion on it and what you think some issues might be. It is essentially a short strangle but you own shares of the underlying and wheel it. So with the usual wheel strategy you sell cash secured puts and generate premium from that and then when assigned sell covered calls above the basis you got assigned on the puts and if its a bullish stock it will eventually pay out. This strategy works similarly except you buy 100 shares of the underlying and sell both OTM calls and OTM puts This way you can profit if the stocks go up or stays even. If you get assigned on your call its above what you bought the shares for so you make profit along with the puts you sold that expire worthless. If the stock stays between the 2 strikes it will act similarly to a iron condor and you just get to keep the premium. If you get assigned on the puts you just buy more shares of the underlying which dollar cost averages your initial shares meaning you can sell more covered calls at a lower basis to breakeven and make profit. Essentially its the wheel but you benefit if the stock stays the same and goes up but if the stock goes down it just DCAs your shares. As long as its a bullish stock and you have enough capital you can just keep dollar cost averaging your way down and the stock would have to rebound a minimal amount for you to still make profit on the shares and you keep all the premium you farmed a long the way from either side. I'm sure there is probably something I have forgotten about or not taken account so please leave your thoughts in the comments.","positive"

GOGO is currently working on launching Gogo5G which will deliver 25 Mbps on average with peak speeds in the 7580 Mbps range.  The Why  GOGO is one of the highest shorted stocks with 37.15 of the float sold short. Now you may wonder why this is relevant well it's because GOGO is looking to break through the $20 resistance where it can move up without much technical resistance and it has all the right factors going for it.  The How  GOGO is already up 87 this year and the shorts have been suffering heavily. This is the perfect moment for their positions to collapse. As the shorts will already be looking to derisk in the current market environment it gives the stock an even bigger momentum push.  Speaking about the market GOGO has been going up against it and is green during red days. It's showing what we like to call regard strength.  The Fundamental amp Technical  1. It was recently added to the SampP SmallCap 600 Index so the passive investors are all buying. This is supported by the fact that volume has exploded since. 2. Traders are buying in due to momentum and the high short percentage. Supported by the chart and volume as well. 3. It's currently testing levels not seen since 2015.  The Hypothesis  In my opinion $40 is easily achievable in the short term under the current dynamics and the fundamentalstechnicals. The chart looks like it is ready for a parabolic move.  The Position  GOGO 5202022 $20.00 CALL. Still cheap due to low IV and gives me a month for the breakout to occur. Any positive market day could cause it. it's also pumping today during a fear day which is a great sign.

"DD CNHI is my high conviction play","Listen up apes I got a play for you. Get out your crayons and take notes.  The stock I am going to introduce you to is CNHI. Many of you may know it as a boring tractor company. But step aside Ryan Cohen a new big daddy CEO is in town.  Scott Wine took over as CEO in January of last year and has already placed an Insider Buy for over 3 million worth of stock. He has split up CNHI so that they focus more purely on agriculture now making them a more agile company.  The most exciting part for me is that they just acquired Raven Industries for a bit over $2 billion. This makes them a contender in the high growth high profit margin industry that is autonomous driving tractors and other high tech ag equipment. They are becoming Deere but without the lawsuits or overpriced stock. To double down on this investment they announced 18 days ago that they are going to be building an advanced engineering center in Nevada USA in order to further propel their high tech farming advancements as well as attract talent to come work for them.  Scott Wine is the former CEO of Polaris and he absolutely transformed that company and exploded the stock. Just look I got my crayons out for you guys. The red circle is when Scott Wine took over in 2008. He took Polaris and made it into a global company imagine what he can do to CNHI.  ampx200B  formatpjpgampautowebpampsb0735c5eacc8fc522dd994dec12d9c2b28ffacdf  To be honest I am getting tired of doing DD If you can even call this that so I'll make this even briefer than I had planned and just spit some other factors that I am bullish about real quick. Ill also tag on some pictures.  CNHI is cheap compared to peers 11.74 pe such as Deere 23.19 and CAT 18.35 and even shitty Kubota 13.7 is more expensive  CNHI beats all recent earnings calls like crazy  Q1 2021 beat EPS by 128  Q2 2021  beat EPS by 57.46  Q3 2021  beat eps by 70.62  Q4 2021  beat eps by 19.48   Revenue were also all positives but I'm too lazy to type those all out look it up yourself.  Coincidently I saw a big ass Case tractor on the way home today and boy did it look sexy. I think this is a sign to buy.  Also this nice little picture shows you how it just bounced off the support line and is about to go up to the MOON  ampx200B  formatpjpgampautowebpampsfaa91378f7ca62f54150ad56c9cd3b9b537625b9  Also go to raven industries site  Raven Industries  Raven Industries  you will be impressed. CNHI is doing just as much cool stuff as Deere but it's not priced in yet. We are on the verge of an agriculture revolution and CNHI is poised to take the main stage.  Positions I lost most of my fun money gambling on HMHC sad face so I have to play it safer on this one since I cant afford to lose my savings. If you guys give me more DD and conformation bias then screw it Ill get more options. Currently I hold 110 shares 1 520 $15 call 1 617 $15 call.  If I had money to blow I'd buy the shit out of May or June $17.5 calls. Earnings will be May 3 and I expect it to move fast after another earning beats.

See previous DD  Most technical analysis techniques look at historical prices to divine future prices. This technical analysis focuses instead on the current Option Open Interest. In other words my crayons taste different.  Whenever the stock price blue touches the delta neutral line green and crosses back up it tends to go another 58.  I developed a tool which uses the entire open interest to calculate three important numbers  Delta Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option delta is 0.  Gamma Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is 0.  Gamma Maximum  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is the maximum.  The theory behind it is simple enough institutions tend to be the largest holders of short options contracts and are therefore obligated to hedge against those options contracts while collecting juicy premium riskfree.  By calculating similar numbers to what these institutions are dependent on I'm hoping to ride their coattails and earn tendies from their rounding errors.

"Making Bank Using Leverage and Options I promise its not as bad as it sounds"," If You Had To Point Out The Flaws Of The Stock Market Relative To Other Asset Classes What Would They Be  Theres a long list of them high volatility sequence of return risk low cashflow high efficiency and liquidity this could be a pro or con depending on how you look at it lack of significant leverage etc.  Out of all those things however were gonna focus on two of them. The lack of cashflow and the lack of leverage. Both of these things are abundant in real estate in particular. A good rental multifamily can be expected to have a cap rate of 712 with a cash on cash return ideally around 15 or higher. This is because 1 real estate does not rely upon appreciation solely it relies upon the income it generates from the renters and 2 investment properties typically only need a 20 down payment in order to purchase.  Thats a 51 leverage ratio which would be impossible to achieve safely in the stock market.  Now it used to be that stocks had lower appreciation and higher dividend yields however that has not been the case for 70 years at least.  You can take a look at this dividend yield chart of the SampP 500 for reference.  formatpngampautowebpampsc4d2968767da41b9c7914a3b2fb641edbc6d10de   Luckily We Can Turn The Stock Market Back Into An Income Machine Using Options  This is the whole premise of the thetagang position. We replace our stock appreciation with premiums received from selling options as a sort of dividend yield.  So we turn to selling puts and calls on SPX or SPY or whatever index you prefer. Thats great but if we compare it back to real estate were still missing the essential component of leverage.  Thats where leveraged ETFs come in.  The pros and cons of LEFTs have been hotly debated but what settled it for me personally was this post by hedgefundie and this article about volatility decay If you don't want to read through all of that I've condensed down the important stuff regarding volatility decay and proper diversification in this postswamputm_campaignpostamputm_mediumweb. But basically assuming it works perhaps we can change it from capital appreciation to income generation using options.  Surely that should work right  Well it should if we do it correctly to avoid assignment as much as possible.  Leveraged ETFs suffer from something called volatility decay basically just describing the idea that a when a loss is incurred a greater gain needs to be made to square ourselves back to zero. With leverage we magnify our risk to this factor.  So because we have more vulnerability to downside lets protect ourselves using a bit of probability.   Using Standard Deviation To Calculate Probabilities  Lets just assume for the moment that all market movements are as good as being random. Yes they are based on data but if we dont have access to said data the movements may as well be random.  Under this assumption we can then also assume that there are probabilities to which direction a stock is going to move. There should be roughly a 50 chance that the stock will go up or down at any given moment.  On top of that we could also assume that larger movements are less likely than smaller movements mainly due to the fact that it takes much larger sudden inflows and outflows of cash to make a stock behave that way. Now some stocks have a relatively higher ability to make a significant move in either direction but even these stocks still have boundaries where they will be unlikely to move.  A good example of this how wild Teslas swings are relative to General Electric. Tesla has a higher relative swing compared to General Electric but even Tesla is unlikely to swing to $30 or $5000 in the next year.  Now these observations we just made are the fundamental ideas behind the concept of standard deviation.  Standard deviation essentially says that within a given time frame usually a year a stock has a certain probability of being within certain price ranges based on its volatility its ability to make wild swings like Tesla.  formatpngampautowebpampsad20b147792f9eb6d33617c18bd6d4722b526bc9  As you can see at the bottom of the chart we see that at each increasing or decreasing standard deviation 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 etc there is less of a probability that our data or in this case the stock price will fall into this range given a normal distribution.  If you add up all the percentages between 1 and 1 we get a 68.2 chance that our stock price will fall in this range. This is called the first standard deviation. If we expand out the 2 and 2 then we get a 95.4 chance that our stock price will fall within the range. That is called the second standard deviation. If we go out to the 3 on each side we get a 98.8 chance that the stock price will fall within the range. With each standard deviation the chance that a stock price will fall within the range gets higher albeit at a much slower rate.   So What Does This Have To Do With Selling Options  Using these standard deviations we can get probabilities that a stock will fall within a certain range. If we use something called Implied Volatility we can figure out what the market thinks that one standard deviation is. Then using that we can predict what probability our option has of expiring in the money which is what we dont want.  To find implied volatility we can go to a website like volafy.net and get the implied volatility percentage. In the case of TQQQ QQQ leveraged 3x the implied volatility is 80 at this time of writing.  Using this percentage we can plug it into a handy formula to calculate the standard deviation for any specific option.  The formula looks like this  sqrtoption days until expiration365  implied volatility  current stock price  In written terms basically we divide the days until expiration by 365 then take the square root of that and multiply it by the implied volatility percentage and the current stock price.  That gives us the amount in dollars of the first standard deviation. If you take that amount and add it AND subtract it from the current price it will give you the range the stock will fall within 68 of the time.  Right now we are interested in selling puts on TQQQ without getting exercised so well sell at one standard deviation out of the money. At the current price of TQQQ $51.84 the first standard deviation out of the money would be $38.11 which is also 51.84  13.73.  If we go back up to our standard deviation chart we can see that on the left side of the chart the side that represents our OTM options we can add up all the percentages before the 1st standard deviation mark. This comes out to be a 15.9 that our OTM option will become ITM by expiration you might have noticed that this percentage closely correlates with the delta of the option which is a good way to gauge it as well. If we are selling monthly options this comes out to be getting assigned once out of every six months on average. To me those seem like pretty good odds.  So lets go down to the $38 strike put on TQQQ which is trading $128 per contract right now. Thats a 3.37 ROI in 40 days or 30.75 annually.  If we assume assignment three times a year that wipes out any premiums made for that given month we are still sitting on a 20.64 CAGR.   But Wait Isnt This Riskier Than Selling Puts On Regular Old QQQ  This is the beauty of it you have the same risk of getting assigned on TQQQ as you do with QQQ if you stay at the same standard deviation but still receive 3x the premium. This is because with TQQQ higher volatility we sell further OTM than we would with regular QQQ but still receive the high premiums due to it being a leveraged product.  If you do happen to get assigned no worries Personally I would recommend that you simply just sell out of the position at the current price and open a new put for the next month. The reason why I say this as opposed to selling a call is that calls do not have the same volatility risk premium that puts do and therefore do not sell for as much. If you want to read more there is this paperreprep1amptypepdf which discusses the outperformance of a put writing only strategy that outperforms during bearflat markets. If you open a new put you are simply taking the loss for that month with the intention that the high win rate probability of this trading strategy will make you square again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS STRATEGY ON ANYTHING BESIDES INDEXES if you do chances are that eventually that stock will get wiped out and never recover I'm looking at you TLRY. Indexes on the other hand do recover you don't need to look any further than this chart to prove it.

Everything was in the red so it was pretty realistic and I started scrolling down my portfollio showing him some of the stocks I own.  I then got to NOK. And as we looked at it it went up to $20. I said that's unusual for a stock to go up that much in just a short time and no sooner had the words left my mouth did it go to $40. And then I got interested and it went to $80. So I was buying like a fucking tramp on chips and it went all the way to $254. Stayed around the $250 mark for a couple of minutes and then went back down to about $116 before eventually going all the way back to the start I obviously did not sell in time.  Anyway.

"SPY week 15","The Spy Friday rose as a phenomenal rate and I think it was more than just volume.  Before trading hours we saw the SPY dropping at a remarkable rate. Is this a supply chain issue with China I saw a recent spike in the spread of Covid over the weekend with Chinas hardcore Covid policies Im sure it will affect the supply chain like it did mid March.  How does everyone feel about the week on SPY Is it a PUT or Call week  Currently the SPY is 442.07","negative"

"$SPY  Predictions for the week of 411","Last week I said that SPY was going to slope down with nothing crazy that happened except my 5 day forecast got inversed.  The days that I thought would be bearish were actually bullish.    I was thinking about this and noticed how there is hundreds of ways the week could play out  that would result in SPY going down.    I am still going to continue the 5 Day Outlook because it is something funny to do just take it with a grain of salt because it is seriously impossible to predict every single day before the futures market even opens... I write these Saturday morning.    ampx200B  1 Day Chartformatpngampautowebpamps27e05d57d4deb60529bae70e73e6937f820f3fa2  The main levels have been the same for about a month now  Support 432  Resistance 452  The RSI is showing the K approaching an oversold reading there will at least be a short term relief in the selling pressure overall  1 Day Chartformatpngampautowebpamps590c166936580732ddbcfe55540e897b0827817c  I would classify the bollinger band with as a somewhat mean reverting indicator to get a sense of the overall volatility.  Since the bollinger bands have a relative wide span we can assume that we will likely be entering a phase of lower volatility.    ampx200B  CPI Data Release Dateformatpngampautowebpamps5317e8515c102614e5d3e4562d01e737d38e4a72  Everyone is going to be watching the CPI data when it is released on Tuesday.  Remember that Ukraine was invaded February 24th so all of the effects on the global markets were felt last month in March.    All retail investors will be watching and all of Wall Street will be watching.  This is not going to be pretty...  FAO Food Price Indexformatpngampautowebpampse34b8ef7f7ab646a82ab92ddeb390904aae8bf20  Food prices have gotten to absurd levels this shows how bad inflation has affected everyone.  ampx200B  10 Year Government Bond Yieldsformatpngampautowebpampsf55675378beeee4b52b194fdd5a0e0b08e6c5d43  I saw this chart floating around that shows a historical trend line of the major economic recessions in the United States and how they correlate to to the 10Y yield.     30 Year Bond Yield Compared to SPXformatpngampautowebpampsf3c71b58593de6c7c8bab287a6604785595a46d2  I was looking around and can conclude that the 30 Year bond Yields have more variation but are a better indicator for timing the end of an economic cycle.  There is nothing to be done now I am just waiting.  I still have a lot of positions open when this crash starts I will start to liquidate everything... believe me it will be very noticeable when it starts.   ampx200B  Federal Reserve FOMC statementformatpngampautowebpamps12b1e18659efc463475d55f038f17d0baf6db894  Bullard is concerned for the economy and wants at least a 50 to 75bp rate hike.  I actually found this kind of interesting because he is one of the least corrupt people in office.  He has a net worth around 5 million which is surprisingly low for having inside information.  He also has never worked with big banks and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.  He definitely knows what is going on and what needs to be done to save the economy.  The federal reserve will eventually have to become more aggressive in rate hikes.  ampx200B  Crude Oil CFDsformatpngampautowebpampsd943fa66e23d9a16dc6745f34c4e1246e88f48dd  Predictions  Tuesday is going to be an extremely important day.  I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10.  Oil rose 35 in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5 which is going to shock the markets.    Another factor is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.    The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.  I hate to be that person but over the last year with unemployment decreasing spending increasing and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80 without interfering.  At most there will be a 50 bear market similar to 2008.  The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell then it should recover in the following days.

"Statistical approche of trading options","   My idea is simple and u just need office 365 at least it's more comfortable that way.  1. I get every available daily last price for a ticker. 2. For every day I calculate how a trade would have performed if I would have held for x Days x is the count of days till expiration 3. I choose how far away from the money I want to trade depends on the strategy 4. I divide the number of trades that would have gone in your favor by the number of total trades 5. Done  Example for my current position in $WFC  Setup  I sold a put option with expiration on April 14.  3 DTE with a strike of 46.50$   Currently the stock is 56 above my strike.  Statistics 1   Within the past 6888 trading days $WFC dropped by 56 in 3 Days 280 times   2806888 is 407  gt The statistical chance of being assigned is therefore this exact 407  Delta is currently 0.168. for me that is overvalued although i know about earnings call at Friday  Statistics 2  WFC had it's last high on March 22 which are 17 DTE until 14.4.. At this day the high was 54.18$.  The distance to my strike is therefore 1417.  WFC has fallen by 1417 within 17 days 146 times.  1466888  212  That makes a 212 Chance of getting assigned.  I know things are not necessarily so simple but without special events this is a good statistical edge you can get.","positive"

"Gapped up and gapped down stocks  good strategy potential"," Does anyone here currently use after market gap analysis to identify stock likely to shift dramatically on market next day open  Here's the basics   Gapping occurs when the price of a stock or another asset opens above or below the previous day's close with no trading activity in between. A gap is the area discontinuity in a security's price chart. Gaps may materialize when headlines cause market fundamentals to change rapidly during hours when markets are typically closed for instance the result of an earnings call afterhours.  Gapping may also refer to the difference or spread in rates at which banks borrow and lend. The dynamic gap measures how assets money held and liabilities money loaned change over time.  Here's a good example from last week  HP Inc NYSE HPQ stock price gapped up 18.6 after Warren Buffett revealed that Berkshire Hathaway had acquired 121 million shares.  This lead to this early jump in price  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps99ec8ea9b665f008f2a57cbfc85a9183636d0cec     You can use sites such as barchart.com to run gap up and gap down stock analysis to identify potential targets for profits out of the gates on markets open.  More often that not a gapup will encourage a 'buy' and gapdown will encourage a 'sell'.  However you need to gauge the momentum behind the stock and trend to decide what is the appropriate strategy to deploy however as a simple start point gap circumstances can roughly be categorised as such  1. A breakaway gap Sell short and place a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. 2. An exhaustion gap  prices pull back into it the next day The downtrend is over Cover shorts immediately. 3. Another exhaustion gap marked by a lack of new highs after the gap Several days of churning offer good shorting opportunities with a stop above the high. 4. A continuation gap in a downtrend Go short with a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. Prices hit that stop a few days later  no method is failsafe. 5. An exhaustion gap closed two days after it opened Cover shorts immediately. 6. A common gap in the midst of a congestion area closed the next day No action recommended. 7. A breakaway gap Go long and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. 8. A continuation gap Add to longs and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. The gap at the right edge of the chart could be either a continuation or an exhaustion gap. Relatively quiet volume suggests continuation. If you buy place a protective stop a few ticks below the lower rim of this gap.  In the HP example above this was a breakaway gap with sufficient indicator and fundamental analysis to tell you this was a 'BUY'.  In any case a good solid strategy to nail down and add to the arsenal.","positive"

Remarkably for a drug intended for chronic use the Phase I safety study tested only a single administration of the drug with subjects monitored for only one week  ...  Of even greater concern safety data from the Ph2a and Ph2b studies cannot not be relied upon due to concerns raised about the conduct of a key investigator only very recently...

"This guy wont take delivery of his egg future contracts. What to do shitpost","So I've done some work for the poultry industry in the past.  Because of the bird flu scare they wanted to unload a ton of eggs quickly at cut rate costs.  They reached out to me because they know I am on WSB and do some day trading.  I saw this opportunity and agreed to sell some futures contracts.  I ended up selling the agreed upon allotment of DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures.  Turns out I probably could have sold those contracts for way more than I did but we farmers and I wanted to make sure the eggs would move before they went bad.  I only took a 5 cut and the rest goes to the farmers so every contract sold did ok.  If we held out a little longer we could've cleared at least another 20 or more.  Needless to say the farmers have had to massacre their chicken stocks because of the bird flu.  So this one guy that we sold some contracts to wanted more.  Despite being over capacity the farmers wanted to sell more to make up for the fact they were making less per egg.  The farmers coop accepted his contract offers and we'd make more eggs.  This meant all of us myself the farmers and their kids etc. would have to put in the OT to make sure we filled this order.       Now the buyer of the contracts is saying he was messed up when he bought the contracts and cant take physical delivery of the final 10 contracts because of the size of his storage location.  A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs.  A tonne of eggs is anywhere between 1086 and 1736 dozens of eggs.  In total we are talking about over 1 million eggs.  How do you buy a contract and not know that you do not have appropriate storage let alone 10 contracts  Also for reference a chicken will lay one egg per day if youre lucky.  To fill this over sized order we were sitting there jacking off roosters for a week straight to get all of the chicken jizz and then had to finger every hen to knock them up to get the eggs made.  If you turn on a black light in my place you'd go blind and I have a few roosters following me around and sending me chocolates and flowers.     What should I do  I need this guy to take the damn eggs.","negative"

"This is a blessing in disguise but Im stupid like the rest of yall","Ok look  I know yall are a bunch of autist who only care about tomorrows price action but listen . Yall are getting another chance to buy the stocks you love at amazing discounts . Buying nvidia for less than 250  AMD under 100 FB under 250 and Netflix under 350 Shit disney under 150 These are amazing steals  in my opinion  Like yall fucking bitch and complain about Oh shit I was too late and now this stock is up too damn much or something .   HERES MY PERSONAL experience  Last year when we were talking about if inflation would be bad amd dropped to around 8085 bucks for a long time and I did nothing   then i saw it rip to 160 ish and felt like shit for not buying it around 8085 . OR heres a better one  rblx after its first run to 100 came back down and was sideways at 7080 for a while before running to 140  I again regretted not buying then and now  here it is under 50 .   Now go back to your shitty memories  not your wedding day   Im meaning the feeling of ahh shit i missed out on that rally .   NoW yall see the second part of the title  I think we will probabaly drop more  granted idk how much more could just be a few  or a fuck ton  either way  im waitng for a bigger drop and if I miss the exact bottom  I just hope I catch the rally early on before I completely miss out . Is this a stupid idea ... only time will tell but best believe I have limits set . Like if rblx crosses 60 Im dumping cash in it  if nvidida hits 250 im buying in no matter what . Because fuck me if i miss the bottom but i wont miss the rally .   I am not a financial advisor and nothing is financial advise .","negative"

"Blackstone BX looking good for a repeat performance.","TLDR BX June 130C for $2.60 or less. Exit the trade when BX hits $130 or in three weeks.  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps2498f6f5c9f51d043e76d7a2e4c9b2e1a2ff9ec0  It looks like BX is primed to once again hit a technical rally. See previous DD  Most technical analysis techniques look at historical prices to divine future prices. This technical analysis focuses instead on the current Option Open Interest. In other words my crayons taste different.  Whenever the stock price blue touches the delta neutral line green and crosses back up it tends to go another 58.  I developed a tool which uses the entire open interest to calculate three important numbers  Delta Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option delta is 0.  Gamma Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is 0.  Gamma Maximum  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is the maximum.  The theory behind it is simple enough institutions tend to be the largest holders of short options contracts and are therefore obligated to hedge against those options contracts while collecting juicy premium riskfree.  By calculating similar numbers to what these institutions are dependent on I'm hoping to ride their coattails and earn tendies from their rounding errors.  Positions   BX  June 130C at $2.16  Will buy when market opens. Targeting to pay less than $2.60share for the contracts.","positive"
