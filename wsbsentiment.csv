Calling all dividend investors  Stop making investment decisions based on high dividend yields A good chunk of them are whats called a yield trap Only relying on dividend yield percentage is a good way to get a dividend cut,Calling all dividend investors   Stop making investment decisions based on high dividend yields   A good chunk of them are what's called a yield trap  Only relying on dividend yield percentage is a good way to get a dividend cut  Few people realize this until the dividend gets cut and it's too late  I look for businesses that will continue to pay dividends raise those dividends higher than inflation and they have growth divers that will increase their share price  Stay away from high dividend yields   gt Find out why the company has such a high dividend yield before considering it   gt Yields that appear unrealistically high often end up being suspended or cut leaving investors who bought the stock just for the dividend disappointed,negative

Statistical approche of trading options,   My idea is simple and u just need office 365 at least it's more comfortable that way  1 I get every available daily last price for a ticker 2 For every day I calculate how a trade would have performed if I would have held for x Days x is the count of days till expiration 3 I choose how far away from the money I want to trade depends on the strategy 4 I divide the number of trades that would have gone in your favor by the number of total trades 5 Done  Example for my current position in WFC  Setup  I sold a put option with expiration on April 14  3 DTE with a strike of 4650   Currently the stock is 56 above my strike  Statistics 1   Within the past 6888 trading days WFC dropped by 56 in 3 Days 280 times   2806888 is 407  gt The statistical chance of being assigned is therefore this exact 407  Delta is currently 0168 for me that is overvalued although i know about earnings call at Friday  Statistics 2  WFC had it's last high on March 22 which are 17 DTE until 144 At this day the high was 5418  The distance to my strike is therefore 1417  WFC has fallen by 1417 within 17 days 146 times  1466888  212  That makes a 212 Chance of getting assigned  I know things are not necessarily so simple but without special events this is a good statistical edge you can get,neutral

analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10  Oil rose 35 in March reaching a high over 130 per barrel  I am expecting inflation to be at least 85 which is going to shock the markets    Another factor is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now  The covid crash was not a complete recession but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes    The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome  I hate to be that person but over the last year with unemployment decreasing spending increasing and now inflation accelerating this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80 without interfering  At most there will be a 50 bear market similar to 2008  The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell then it should recover in the following days    Not professional financial advice do not solely make your trades based on my opinions I encourage everyone to research more   TLDR

to stop today To color me impressed would be an understatement Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend

the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday monthly option expiration   Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls 16k at 437p   Thursday monthly has 15k 445c 55k 450c Otherwise 121k

a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430 The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too   With the last CPI being 75 expected at 79 but the consensus at 84 its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow But with this being the first CPI with war gas prices more covid etc I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to

heck of a red day today too mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2774 today I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema I did not however expect it to happen today However I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning   Apple now is in an interesting place Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158 However my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again Apple is a risky play here   Channel support tomorrow is 157 unlimited downside and resistance is 1666 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 1686 would be a bullish signal However if Apple loses 16554 daily 100ema we can expect further downside this week   I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning Before the small intraday recovery I may reenter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish   ampx200B  httpspreviewredditrvihq1qxqzs81pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps815d5abea3eb8fcfa988a512045e85dccccf6818  The blood for AMD just continues but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive 52 hit which I believe it was down around 6 at one point intraday I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100 This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 7274 This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right   I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema tomorrow most likely to form an official death cross This should give it some continued downside   ampx200B  httpspreviewreddith42lt6cyqzs81pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps656bccd6c7693ffbff25068cf8b80b2484feb77c  Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 25 however after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in Next major support I see for Ford is around 128 and after that is 112  Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I dont suspect the RSI to be an issue   Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this

called out on SPY that 420430 was support I suspected I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out That tells

very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI   Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday The market with the 10 year rising 30 year fixed mortgages rising again the inverted treasury yields inflation covid war gas etc etc etc recession etc etc etc talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two   While some dont think its a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling thats the preample to the downside to come I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow   10 challenge  Today was a fairly good day I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19 a spy put for 20 and a call for 20 I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70 at open that spiked to 30 around the first big drop to 4415 With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at 30 I also played a call and put for 25 then 10 during the sideways chop Followed by during power hour a two separated 10 puts Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal however factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 4415 I would have had a fairly large L to carry Today was a win for me,negative

Inflation is done....kinda,The Fed controls the supply of money  Supply and demand determines value  Just like oil when a lot of supply goes into the market the value of oil goes down  Same thing with money    We do not have a demand issue  The base economy fuckin sucks  We have a supply issue where the Fed supplied so much money into the market they reduced the value of money and caused inflation  Well now it's the opposite  They will be taking out excess supply making the value of money go up to reverse the effects of inflation  BUT they will cause a recession that may already be here   The main component of an economy is consumer spending  Investment government spending and net exports are the others  Inflation is already affecting consumer spending which affects demand which eventually affects employment  The Fed will tame inflation by removing money supply and likely overtame inflation causing a recession  As debt service costs go up consumer demand will decrease and corporations will look to lay off people   We are starting a nasty cyclethat will essentially lead to little or no growth for the next 5 to 10 years   The Fed will again take too long to reverse the inflation taming  But the problem is that we don't actually have a demand driven inflation with a robust economyso what is the end result going to be  Deflation    How long for I got no fuckin idea  So we will start a deflationary process in the next 618 months and the only option will be 0 and printing money again   Expect that within 24 months the printer goes brr again  Yesno one has said this yet but the Fed may cause a deflationary spiral especially if they don't act properly   The problem is I have no idea what to do but I do know one person that does and consistently beats the market when times are tough for equitiesMr Buffet  Go with BRKB and close your eyes for the next 12 months,negative

Real estate market and the broader economy,I know there will be lots of just short the housing market bro responses but I am more interested in the opinions of the OG WSB autists if you guys are still around. Full disclosure I'm not involved in this market.   Papa powell lowered fed rates to almost 0 during the beer virus and printed paper so there were lots of easy money. This money first went into stonks and the market became too hot. Institutional investors had to find an alternative asset class and it seemed like they went into real estate.   As you have noticed the housing market went crazy over the last few years. However I also noticed this insane price hike is mostly for starter homes  aka the houses for entrylevel buyers getting their first home. These starters are singlefamily housesapartmentsduplexescondostownhouses you get the idea. In contrast my older wealthy friends' gt$1M mansion had seen maybe 300k increase while the starter houses my younger friends are looking to buy increased by x2 or x3.   Investors instead of home buyers purchased gt18 of all real estate sold in Q3 2021 alonehttpswww.redfin.comnewsinvestorhomepurchasesq32021. Firms like BlackRock has bought 66 apartment complexes in my city  not units entire complexes. I also looked at the prospectus of two REITs Vanguard VNQ and BlackRock USRT and residential is the secondhighest holding in these funds. The top holding is something called Specialized REIT  I wonder if apartment complexes or residential RE holding companies count as such. In both funds' documents they identified increasing interest rates as a significant risk factor. The point is this is just two REITs. There are lots more of these institutional or even individual investors of various sizes buying up starter homes.   ampx200B  With all that said I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on where this is going and how it will end. The following is my speculation and thinkingoutloud so probably not everything makes sense   It seems to me like these institutions are cornering the market by controlling the supply and causing the price to increase and then slowly selling these starter houses to any sucker who would be willing to pay the ridiculous price ... so are they holding a bunch of empty houses waiting for appreciation or are they also renting them out How are the occupy rates   Switching gears  what about the packaging and reselling of these mortgages Anything going on there I know they never stopped selling CDOshttpswww.printfriendly.compgmKya3x after 0809. Like the film ending scene of 'the Big Short' pointed out they are now making 'boutique synthetic CDOs'  and call them 'bespoke tranche opportunity' and there's a lot of activity in producthttpswww.reuters.comarticleidUSL5N22B5Q2.   As interest rates start to increase are institutions gonna fire sale and try to make their rival firms and new home buyers hold the bag I'm not sure of the exact cause or mechanism but if they needed to cooperate and hold it all together they wouldn't  just look at how they handled Bill Hwang's swaps. They all agreed to slowly unwind but right after the meeting when Credit Susse and UBS went to sleep Goldman and Morgan immediate offloaded and tanked those stonks and market in general. That's relatively small in comparison to the entire housing market.   Anyway I would love to hear your opinions thoughts and insights on this. Thanks for reading my rant.,negative

Russian Palladium Refiners banned by London's Platinum and Palladium Market and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange SBSW and other nonRussian Palladium companies stand to gain massively,On Friday the London Platinum and Palladium Market a major trading venue for Palladium and other platinum group metals banned two major Russian state owned Palladium refineries from having their Palladium and Platinum sold on the LPPM's London and Zurich exchangeshttpswww.marketwatch.comstorypalladiumandplatinumpricesjumpafterlondonmarketblocksrussianpreciousmetals11649521364. This was followed up by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also banning the same Russian state owned refiners todayhttpsfinance.yahoo.comnewspalladiumextendsgainssuspensionrussian234518049.html. Additionally the Japanese Exchange Group's Osaka exchange is now also reviewing whether or not to ban Russian Palladium and Platinum refiners. This has major implications in the Palladium market as Russia produces about 40 of the world's Palladium.httpswww.reddit.comrwallstreetbetscommentss72z1uhow_to_profit_off_a_russian_invasion_of_ukraine Russia's Palladium and Platinum exports were one of the very last major Russian exports left that were not subject to any major sanctions. As civilian deaths mount in the RussoUkrainian War more and more pressure will mount on Western governments and financial regulators to cut Russia further out of the world markets. Any removal of Russian palladium from the world market gives an excellent opportunity for nonRussian Palladium producers to profit. Aside from Russia major palladium mines are located in South Africa the United States and Canada. Palladium is used heavily in both the car industry and electronics industry being used in both catalytic converters and integrated circuits. If major automakers and chip makers are no longer allowed to buy Russian Palladium they will be all forced to compete for Palladium produced by companies like Sibanye Stillwater SBSW which controls nearly all of American Palladium mining production and has major mines in South Africa and Impala Platinum Holdings JSE IMP which has major Canadian and South African mines.

41122 SPY AMD QQQ F Apple VIX Daily TA,    The day before CPI the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my 2 red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days.   The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesnt have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema above for bearish and below for bullish.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.it1hpw0uyrqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps89e988c2486c9a35886e64c0572dda7db4c7f52f  We actually established yet another downward channel today that I dont suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itnzmwaslsqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps460f3ed4daf222a62703d594bc51c6a74e98085e  ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itli7lzt7tqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps4347b8f4c091377d1ce4fba1560a3adac832fe92  We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse.   But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I dont really forsee unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10 that we do it but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.  ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itgk5l6gstqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpampsb1186f1a49dfdb4c8482bfe6b8db71a3e6c0a15d  The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.it14m0bnhuqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpampscb628bb79afa7a42f5d89e96ee5161666ca6c136  The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20 50 and 100 ema on the daily 445.21 446.55 and 446.63 but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside.   Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 unlimited upside BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I dont suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itb7xoaqpvqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps7116303960c6b14d65486a7a6055fe9d2f6ebe3b  Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema 443.96 445.9. The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 weekly 50.   Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday monthly option expiration.   Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p.   Thursday monthly has 15k 445c 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p 66k 435p 113k 430p.  That is a massive amount of OI to the downside thats expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too.   With the last CPI being 7.5 expected at 7.9 but the consensus at 8.4 its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war gas prices more covid etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itzvve2nvwqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpampsd6cb5a86ef7f0a6606d8305928378625e0d55be0  Apple had a heck of a red day today too mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today. I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not however expect it to happen today. However I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning.   Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here.   Channel support tomorrow is 157 unlimited downside and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However if Apple loses 165.54 daily 100ema we can expect further downside this week.   I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may reenter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itrvihq1qxqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps815d5abea3eb8fcfa988a512045e85dccccf6818  The blood for AMD just continues but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive 5.2 hit which I believe it was down around 6 at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 7274. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right.   I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema tomorrow most likely to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.ith42lt6cyqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps656bccd6c7693ffbff25068cf8b80b2484feb77c  Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5 however after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.  Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I dont suspect the RSI to be an issue.   Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.it26yjjyxyqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps7e647a1487ff5cbb7889db0f47334e17a6429f2b  QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how.   Channel support is 322 unlimited downside and resistance is 342 for tomorrow.   I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20 50 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.itqghek3jzqzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps50292337467bbf1fd1b3d55a377e4955d987401b  The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11 from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels but mind you that was on the downside not the upside.   ampx200B  httpspreview.redd.it1dkbfa40rzs81.pngwidth975ampformatpngampautowebpamps718eb38d4ea8f47c4467f046cff1e33dd4fed944  When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI.   Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising 30 year fixed mortgages rising again the inverted treasury yields inflation covid war gas etc. etc. etc. recession etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two.   While some dont think its a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of... took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling thats the preample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow.   10 challenge  Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19 a spy put for 20 and a call for 20. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70 at open that spiked to 30 around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at 30. I also played a call and put for 25 then 10 during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10 puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal however factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.,positive

Gapped up and gapped down stocks  good strategy potential, Does anyone here currently use after market gap analysis to identify stock likely to shift dramatically on market next day open  Here's the basics   Gapping occurs when the price of a stock or another asset opens above or below the previous day's close with no trading activity in between. A gap is the area discontinuity in a security's price chart. Gaps may materialize when headlines cause market fundamentals to change rapidly during hours when markets are typically closed for instance the result of an earnings call afterhours.  Gapping may also refer to the difference or spread in rates at which banks borrow and lend. The dynamic gap measures how assets money held and liabilities money loaned change over time.  Here's a good example from last week  HP Inc NYSE HPQ stock price gapped up 18.6 after Warren Buffett revealed that Berkshire Hathaway had acquired 121 million shares.  This lead to this early jump in price  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps99ec8ea9b665f008f2a57cbfc85a9183636d0cec     You can use sites such as barchart.com to run gap up and gap down stock analysis to identify potential targets for profits out of the gates on markets open.  More often that not a gapup will encourage a 'buy' and gapdown will encourage a 'sell'.  However you need to gauge the momentum behind the stock and trend to decide what is the appropriate strategy to deploy however as a simple start point gap circumstances can roughly be categorised as such  1. A breakaway gap Sell short and place a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. 2. An exhaustion gap  prices pull back into it the next day The downtrend is over Cover shorts immediately. 3. Another exhaustion gap marked by a lack of new highs after the gap Several days of churning offer good shorting opportunities with a stop above the high. 4. A continuation gap in a downtrend Go short with a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. Prices hit that stop a few days later  no method is failsafe. 5. An exhaustion gap closed two days after it opened Cover shorts immediately. 6. A common gap in the midst of a congestion area closed the next day No action recommended. 7. A breakaway gap Go long and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. 8. A continuation gap Add to longs and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. The gap at the right edge of the chart could be either a continuation or an exhaustion gap. Relatively quiet volume suggests continuation. If you buy place a protective stop a few ticks below the lower rim of this gap.  In the HP example above this was a breakaway gap with sufficient indicator and fundamental analysis to tell you this was a 'BUY'.  In any case a good solid strategy to nail down and add to the arsenal.,neutral
This guy wont take delivery of his egg future contracts. What to do shitpost,So I've done some work for the poultry industry in the past.  Because of the bird flu scare they wanted to unload a ton of eggs quickly at cut rate costs.  They reached out to me because they know I am on WSB and do some day trading.  I saw this opportunity and agreed to sell some futures contracts.  I ended up selling the agreed upon allotment of DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures.  Turns out I probably could have sold those contracts for way more than I did but we farmers and I wanted to make sure the eggs would move before they went bad.  I only took a 5 cut and the rest goes to the farmers so every contract sold did ok.  If we held out a little longer we could've cleared at least another 20 or more.  Needless to say the farmers have had to massacre their chicken stocks because of the bird flu.  So this one guy that we sold some contracts to wanted more.  Despite being over capacity the farmers wanted to sell more to make up for the fact they were making less per egg.  The farmers coop accepted his contract offers and we'd make more eggs.  This meant all of us myself the farmers and their kids etc. would have to put in the OT to make sure we filled this order.       Now the buyer of the contracts is saying he was messed up when he bought the contracts and cant take physical delivery of the final 10 contracts because of the size of his storage location.  A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs.  A tonne of eggs is anywhere between 1086 and 1736 dozens of eggs.  In total we are talking about over 1 million eggs.  How do you buy a contract and not know that you do not have appropriate storage let alone 10 contracts  Also for reference a chicken will lay one egg per day if youre lucky.  To fill this over sized order we were sitting there jacking off roosters for a week straight to get all of the chicken jizz and then had to finger every hen to knock them up to get the eggs made.  If you turn on a black light in my place you'd go blind and I have a few roosters following me around and sending me chocolates and flowers.     What should I do  I need this guy to take the damn eggs.,negative
NOK to the moon,I had a dream last night that I was explaining my online trading account to my brother. Everything was in the red so it was pretty realistic and I started scrolling down my portfollio showing him some of the stocks I own.  I then got to NOK. And as we looked at it it went up to $20. I said that's unusual for a stock to go up that much in just a short time and no sooner had the words left my mouth did it go to $40. And then I got interested and it went to $80. So I was buying like a fucking tramp on chips and it went all the way to $254. Stayed around the $250 mark for a couple of minutes and then went back down to about $116 before eventually going all the way back to the start I obviously did not sell in time.  Anyway. I'm not sure of the exact time this took place so I've gone and bought shares off the back of it  937  5.33  Admittedly this isn't the best DD you'll ever read. Equally though it's not the worst.

$SPY  Predictions for the week of 411,Last week I said that SPY was going to slope down with nothing crazy that happened except my 5 day forecast got inversed.  The days that I thought would be bearish were actually bullish.    I was thinking about this and noticed how there is hundreds of ways the week could play out  that would result in SPY going down.    I am still going to continue the 5 Day Outlook because it is something funny to do just take it with a grain of salt because it is seriously impossible to predict every single day before the futures market even opens... I write these Saturday morning.    ampx200B  1 Day Chartformatpngampautowebpamps27e05d57d4deb60529bae70e73e6937f820f3fa2  The main levels have been the same for about a month now  Support 432  Resistance 452  The RSI is showing the K approaching an oversold reading there will at least be a short term relief in the selling pressure overall  1 Day Chartformatpngampautowebpamps590c166936580732ddbcfe55540e897b0827817c  I would classify the bollinger band with as a somewhat mean reverting indicator to get a sense of the overall volatility.  Since the bollinger bands have a relative wide span we can assume that we will likely be entering a phase of lower volatility.    ampx200B  CPI Data Release Dateformatpngampautowebpamps5317e8515c102614e5d3e4562d01e737d38e4a72  Everyone is going to be watching the CPI data when it is released on Tuesday.

There is nothing to be done now I am just waiting.  I still have a lot of positions open when this crash starts I will start to liquidate everything... believe me it will be very noticeable when it starts.   ampx200B  Federal Reserve FOMC statementformatpngampautowebpamps12b1e18659efc463475d55f038f17d0baf6db894  Bullard is concerned for the economy and wants at least a 50 to 75bp rate hike.  I actually found this kind of interesting because he is one of the least corrupt people in office.  He has a net worth around 5 million which is surprisingly low for having inside information.  He also has never worked with big banks and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.  He definitely knows what is going on and what needs to be done to save the economy.  The federal reserve will eventually have to become more aggressive in rate hikes.  ampx200B  Crude Oil CFDsformatpngampautowebpampsd943fa66e23d9a16dc6745f34c4e1246e88f48dd  Predictions  Tuesday is going to be an extremely important day.  I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10.  Oil rose 35 in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5 which is going to shock the markets.    Another factor is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.    The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.  I hate to be that person but over the last year with unemployment decreasing spending increasing and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80 without interfering.  At most there will be a 50 bear market similar to 2008.  The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell then it should recover in the following days.    Not professional financial advice do not solely make your trades based on my opinions I encourage everyone to research more   TLDR  formatpngampautowebpamps39172bb2a032402fe4c78d52443440fff4a1a227  I will respond to every comment,neutral
Calling all dividend investors  Stop making investment decisions based on high dividend yields A good chunk of them are whats called a yield trap Only relying on dividend yield percentage is a good way to get a dividend cut,Calling all dividend investors   Stop making investment decisions based on high dividend yields   A good chunk of them are what's called a yield trap  Only relying on dividend yield percentage is a good way to get a dividend cut.  Few people realize this until the dividend gets cut and it's too late.  I look for businesses that will continue to pay dividends raise those dividends higher than inflation and they have growth divers that will increase their share price.  Stay away from high dividend yields.   gt Find out why the company has such a high dividend yield before considering it.   gt Yields that appear unrealistically high often end up being suspended or cut leaving investors who bought the stock just for the dividend disappointed.,negative

GOGO is Going to GOGO to the Moon  SampP SmallCap 600 Index Inclusion Will Squeeze the Near 40 Float Shorted Stock,We're Going to GOGO to the Moon  GOGO which is based in Chicago is an inflight internet company that provides broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market.  GOGO is currently working on launching Gogo5G which will deliver 25 Mbps on average with peak speeds in the 7580 Mbps range.  The Why  GOGO is one of the highest shorted stocks with 37.15 of the float sold short. Now you may wonder why this is relevant well it's because GOGO is looking to break through the $20 resistance where it can move up without much technical resistance and it has all the right factors going for it.  The How  GOGO is already up 87 this year and the shorts have been suffering heavily. This is the perfect moment for their positions to collapse. As the shorts will already be looking to derisk in the current market environment it gives the stock an even bigger momentum push.  Speaking about the market GOGO has been going up against it and is green during red days. It's showing what we like to call regard strength.  The Fundamental amp Technical  1. It was recently added to the SampP SmallCap 600 Index so the passive investors are all buying. This is supported by the fact that volume has exploded since. 2. Traders are buying in due to momentum and the high short percentage. Supported by the chart and volume as well. 3. It's currently testing levels not seen since 2015.  The Hypothesis  In my opinion $40 is easily achievable in the short term under the current dynamics and the fundamentalstechnicals. The chart looks like it is ready for a parabolic move.  The Position  GOGO 5202022 $20.00 CALL. Still cheap due to low IV and gives me a month for the breakout to occur. Any positive market day could cause it. it's also pumping today during a fear day which is a great sign.  TLDR GOGO recently added to SampP SmallCap 600 Index momentum is going to cause covering by the high short percentage.  Ape TLDR GOGO TO THE MOON,positive

Making Bank Using Leverage and Options I promise its not as bad as it sounds, If You Had To Point Out The Flaws Of The Stock Market Relative To Other Asset Classes What Would They Be  Theres a long list of them high volatility sequence of return risk low cashflow high efficiency and liquidity this could be a pro or con depending on how you look at it lack of significant leverage etc.  Out of all those things however were gonna focus on two of them. The lack of cashflow and the lack of leverage. Both of these things are abundant in real estate in particular. A good rental multifamily can be expected to have a cap rate of 712 with a cash on cash return ideally around 15 or higher. This is because 1 real estate does not rely upon appreciation solely it relies upon the income it generates from the renters and 2 investment properties typically only need a 20 down payment in order to purchase.  Thats a 51 leverage ratio which would be impossible to achieve safely in the stock market.  Now it used to be that stocks had lower appreciation and higher dividend yields however that has not been the case for 70 years at least.  You can take a look at this dividend yield chart of the SampP 500 for reference.  formatpngampautowebpampsc4d2968767da41b9c7914a3b2fb641edbc6d10de   Luckily We Can Turn The Stock Market Back Into An Income Machine Using Options  This is the whole premise of the thetagang position. We replace our stock appreciation with premiums received from selling options as a sort of dividend yield.  So we turn to selling puts and calls on SPX or SPY or whatever index you prefer. Thats great but if we compare it back to real estate were still missing the essential component of leverage.  Thats where leveraged ETFs come in.  The pros and cons of LEFTs have been hotly debated but what settled it for me personally was this post by hedgefundie and this article about volatility decay If you don't want to read through all of that I've condensed down the important stuff regarding volatility decay and proper diversification in this postswamputm_campaignpostamputm_mediumweb. But basically assuming it works perhaps we can change it from capital appreciation to income generation using options.  Surely that should work right  Well it should if we do it correctly to avoid assignment as much as possible.  Leveraged ETFs suffer from something called volatility decay basically just describing the idea that a when a loss is incurred a greater gain needs to be made to square ourselves back to zero. With leverage we magnify our risk to this factor.  So because we have more vulnerability to downside lets protect ourselves using a bit of probability.   Using Standard Deviation To Calculate Probabilities  Lets just assume for the moment that all market movements are as good as being random. Yes they are based on data but if we dont have access to said data the movements may as well be random.  Under this assumption we can then also assume that there are probabilities to which direction a stock is going to move. There should be roughly a 50 chance that the stock will go up or down at any given moment.  On top of that we could also assume that larger movements are less likely than smaller movements mainly due to the fact that it takes much larger sudden inflows and outflows of cash to make a stock behave that way. Now some stocks have a relatively higher ability to make a significant move in either direction but even these stocks still have boundaries where they will be unlikely to move.  A good example of this how wild Teslas swings are relative to General Electric. Tesla has a higher relative swing compared to General Electric but even Tesla is unlikely to swing to $30 or $5000 in the next year.  Now these observations we just made are the fundamental ideas behind the concept of standard deviation.  Standard deviation essentially says that within a given time frame usually a year a stock has a certain probability of being within certain price ranges based on its volatility its ability to make wild swings like Tesla.  formatpngampautowebpampsad20b147792f9eb6d33617c18bd6d4722b526bc9  As you can see at the bottom of the chart we see that at each increasing or decreasing standard deviation 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 etc there is less of a probability that our data or in this case the stock price will fall into this range given a normal distribution.  If you add up all the percentages between 1 and 1 we get a 68.2 chance that our stock price will fall in this range. This is called the first standard deviation. If we expand out the 2 and 2 then we get a 95.4 chance that our stock price will fall within the range. That is called the second standard deviation. If we go out to the 3 on each side we get a 98.8 chance that the stock price will fall within the range. With each standard deviation the chance that a stock price will fall within the range gets higher albeit at a much slower rate.   So What Does This Have To Do With Selling Options  Using these standard deviations we can get probabilities that a stock will fall within a certain range. If we use something called Implied Volatility we can figure out what the market thinks that one standard deviation is. Then using that we can predict what probability our option has of expiring in the money which is what we dont want.  To find implied volatility we can go to a website like volafy.net and get the implied volatility percentage. In the case of TQQQ QQQ leveraged 3x the implied volatility is 80 at this time of writing.  Using this percentage we can plug it into a handy formula to calculate the standard deviation for any specific option.  The formula looks like this  sqrtoption days until expiration365  implied volatility  current stock price  In written terms basically we divide the days until expiration by 365 then take the square root of that and multiply it by the implied volatility percentage and the current stock price.  That gives us the amount in dollars of the first standard deviation. If you take that amount and add it AND subtract it from the current price it will give you the range the stock will fall within 68 of the time.  Right now we are interested in selling puts on TQQQ without getting exercised so well sell at one standard deviation out of the money. At the current price of TQQQ $51.84 the first standard deviation out of the money would be $38.11 which is also 51.84  13.73.  If we go back up to our standard deviation chart we can see that on the left side of the chart the side that represents our OTM options we can add up all the percentages before the 1st standard deviation mark. This comes out to be a 15.9 that our OTM option will become ITM by expiration you might have noticed that this percentage closely correlates with the delta of the option which is a good way to gauge it as well. If we are selling monthly options this comes out to be getting assigned once out of every six months on average. To me those seem like pretty good odds.  So lets go down to the $38 strike put on TQQQ which is trading $128 per contract right now. Thats a 3.37 ROI in 40 days or 30.75 annually.  If we assume assignment three times a year that wipes out any premiums made for that given month we are still sitting on a 20.64 CAGR.   But Wait Isnt This Riskier Than Selling Puts On Regular Old QQQ  This is the beauty of it you have the same risk of getting assigned on TQQQ as you do with QQQ if you stay at the same standard deviation but still receive 3x the premium. This is because with TQQQ higher volatility we sell further OTM than we would with regular QQQ but still receive the high premiums due to it being a leveraged product.  If you do happen to get assigned no worries Personally I would recommend that you simply just sell out of the position at the current price and open a new put for the next month. The reason why I say this as opposed to selling a call is that calls do not have the same volatility risk premium that puts do and therefore do not sell for as much. If you want to read more there is this paperreprep1amptypepdf which discusses the outperformance of a put writing only strategy that outperforms during bearflat markets. If you open a new put you are simply taking the loss for that month with the intention that the high win rate probability of this trading strategy will make you square again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS STRATEGY ON ANYTHING BESIDES INDEXES if you do chances are that eventually that stock will get wiped out and never recover I'm looking at you TLRY. Indexes on the other hand do recover you don't need to look any further than this chart to prove it.

This guy wont take delivery of his egg future contracts. What to do shitpost,So I've done some work for the poultry industry in the past.  Because of the bird flu scare they wanted to unload a ton of eggs quickly at cut rate costs.  They reached out to me because they know I am on WSB and do some day trading.  I saw this opportunity and agreed to sell some futures contracts.  I ended up selling the agreed upon allotment of DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures.  Turns out I probably could have sold those contracts for way more than I did but we farmers and I wanted to make sure the eggs would move before they went bad.  I only took a 5 cut and the rest goes to the farmers so every contract sold did ok.  If we held out a little longer we could've cleared at least another 20 or more.  Needless to say the farmers have had to massacre their chicken stocks because of the bird flu.  So this one guy that we sold some contracts to wanted more.  Despite being over capacity the farmers wanted to sell more to make up for the fact they were making less per egg.  The farmers coop accepted his contract offers and we'd make more eggs.  This meant all of us myself the farmers and their kids etc. would have to put in the OT to make sure we filled this order.       Now the buyer of the contracts is saying he was messed up when he bought the contracts and cant take physical delivery of the final 10 contracts because of the size of his storage location.  A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs.  A tonne of eggs is anywhere between 1086 and 1736 dozens of eggs.  In total we are talking about over 1 million eggs.  How do you buy a contract and not know that you do not have appropriate storage let alone 10 contracts  Also for reference a chicken will lay one egg per day if youre lucky.  To fill this over sized order we were sitting there jacking off roosters for a week straight to get all of the chicken jizz and then had to finger every hen to knock them up to get the eggs made.  If you turn on a black light in my place you'd go blind and I have a few roosters following me around and sending me chocolates and flowers.     What should I do  I need this guy to take the damn eggs.,negative

Musk hints at Tesla's Lithium mining entry...two years after it already allegedly entered the market,  For those who don't remember two years ago Musk and Tesla announced his easy it was to extract lithium from clay and salt and a revolutionary new process at its 2020 battery day.  Allegedly 10000 acres of property rights in Nevada were bought noone has ever seen public land registry relating.  Even though Geochemists from established Lithium miners were unable to perform such alchemy Musk was going to of course.  Yet here we are again with Musk talking up Tesla's entry into Lithium mining.  At least it seems some in the media are finally at least keeping track of the embellishments and hype if not directly daring to cite the BS.  Anyone who has actually done a little homework on Lithium mining will know contrary to popular media reports that many far better informed Geochemists have tried and failed similar techniques that Musk is citing as far back as the 1920's.  To get the salt to react with the lithium silicates requires heating it to 1000 degrees centigrade.  The energy required makes it ridiculously uneconomical versus traditional brine extraction processes.  The Pied Piper continues to play his tunes.,negative
 Can I refuse delivery on 50 tons of Egg futures ,So I went a bit overboard with DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures. I took a bunch of drugs and my friend had a bird and idk why but it made me think a Bird flu strain coming this year so I got a shit ton of contracts.   Turns out I hit the lottery as farmers across the nation massacred their chicken stocks cuz of bird flu. I got in at about 3750 a contract and cashed out at 4400.   I apparently did not get all of my Contracts out and now I have people contacting me saying I need to take physical delivery of 10 contracts. A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs  I live in an apartment I cannot take delivery of 50 tons of eggs What do I do I made a killing so I can hire whoever I need to to make this go away but can someone help me I do not want 50 tons of eggs coming to my door.  Would it be illegal for me to list delivery address as the nearest federal reserve building  For referenceperspective there are between approx 1174 and 2381 DOZEN eggs in a single ton. This puts me at approx 720000  1.2 million eggs. I am really Stressing out over the logistics of how the fuck Id ship out this amount of eggs to shelters. It would have to be SO many shelters.

DD short future contracts on eggs,I believe there is artificial demand for eggs currently because of some bird flu outbreak that was temporarily pumping the price of eggs. This coupled with unusual future buying has caused the price of eggs to be much higher than it should be.  I believe there is an estimated float of 50 tons of eggs that have yet to be delivered or sold. Once these eggs are delivered the price of egg futures should tank as this will lead to a surplus of egg commodities on the market with low buyers.  I would even be confident that this 50 ton egg order isnt even going into the egg market. Which means this egg order will probably be repod or just completely lost to churn. If this happens the future price of eggs will crash because 50 tons were delivered but not sold on the commodity market. This leads farmers to believe this elevated demand for eggs will continue causing oversupply and supply shocks decreasing price despite bird flu worries.  I cant explain where Ive heard this figure of 50 tons of eggs being purchased in the market but not used in the commodity market but I assure you short future contracts will print once this order gets essentially wasted.,negative

By Rep. Earl Blumenauer DOR  After working on cannabis reform for decades we hit another critical threshold Congress passed both the comprehensive MORE Act which is the gold standard in cannabis reform and my Medical Marijuana Research Act.    Make no mistake. The reason we are at this moment and poised to end the tragic unfair and misguided prohibition on cannabis is because the people got there first. Thirtyeight states have enacted medical marijuana and 18 states have determined that adult use should be legal. In total 98 percent of the population has access to some form of legalized cannabis because at the state level the fact that over twothirds of the public favor full legalization matters. While the federal government isnt there yet that too is changing.  The Senate can put these pieces inline with each other  banking comprehensive reform and research.,positive
Short Strangle Wheel option strategy idea,   tldr  Wheel but you also have 100 shares of the underlying and sell Covered calls along with the Cash secured puts.  So there are many ways to describe this strategy and I don't know if others have already come up with it they probably have but I wanted to know your guys opinion on it and what you think some issues might be. It is essentially a short strangle but you own shares of the underlying and wheel it. So with the usual wheel strategy you sell cash secured puts and generate premium from that and then when assigned sell covered calls above the basis you got assigned on the puts and if its a bullish stock it will eventually pay out. This strategy works similarly except you buy 100 shares of the underlying and sell both OTM calls and OTM puts This way you can profit if the stocks go up or stays even. If you get assigned on your call its above what you bought the shares for so you make profit along with the puts you sold that expire worthless. If the stock stays between the 2 strikes it will act similarly to a iron condor and you just get to keep the premium. If you get assigned on the puts you just buy more shares of the underlying which dollar cost averages your initial shares meaning you can sell more covered calls at a lower basis to breakeven and make profit. Essentially its the wheel but you benefit if the stock stays the same and goes up but if the stock goes down it just DCAs your shares. As long as its a bullish stock and you have enough capital you can just keep dollar cost averaging your way down and the stock would have to rebound a minimal amount for you to still make profit on the shares and you keep all the premium you farmed a long the way from either side. I'm sure there is probably something I have forgotten about or not taken account so please leave your thoughts in the comments.,neutral

It's chief competition Amazon is experiencing unionization and increasingly poor reputation for quality control of its vendors. It shouldn't take a phD in statistics to divinate which products are scams and which are real but its getting that way and my brain is too smooth for that shit. Walmart's online retail business is growing steadily and will continue to regain share from Amazon.   Stagflation and skyrocketing food prices will further drive sales.

Inflation is done....kinda,The Fed controls the supply of money.  Supply and demand determines value.  Just like oil when a lot of supply goes into the market the value of oil goes down.  Same thing with money.    We do not have a demand issue.  The base economy fuckin sucks.  We have a supply issue where the Fed supplied so much money into the market they reduced the value of money and caused inflation.  Well now it's the opposite.  They will be taking out excess supply making the value of money go up to reverse the effects of inflation.  BUT they will cause a recession that may already be here.   The main component of an economy is consumer spending.  Investment government spending and net exports are the others.  Inflation is already affecting consumer spending which affects demand which eventually affects employment.  The Fed will tame inflation by removing money supply and likely overtame inflation causing a recession.  As debt service costs go up consumer demand will decrease and corporations will look to lay off people.   We are starting a nasty cycle....that will essentially lead to little or no growth for the next 5 to 10 years.   The Fed will again take too long to reverse the inflation taming.  But the problem is that we don't actually have a demand driven inflation with a robust economy...so what is the end result going to be  Deflation.    How long for I got no fuckin idea.  So we will start a deflationary process in the next 618 months and the only option will be 0 and printing money again.   Expect that within 24 months the printer goes brr again.  Yes...no one has said this yet but the Fed may cause a deflationary spiral especially if they don't act properly.

China binds Russian business. Entrepreneurs are switching to the yuan,As stated by money.pl   gt Sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine are pushing Russia into the orbit of Chinese influence.  Economic cooperation is tightening but Beijing plays a dominant role in this arrangement.  Dreams of a big ruble are falling aside.  Russian business is already switching to yuan billing and the Chinese are buying Russian oil and coal for their currency  gt Although Vladimir Putin dreamed of a petrublel and settlements with the West in the Russian currency the economic reality reveals this dream.  It is not the ruble but the yuan that has a much greater influence in the region and with each day of sanctions China's position will strengthen drawing Russia into an orbit of dependence and influence.  gt Russian banks have already recorded a sharp increase in the number of accounts in yuan writes Rzeczpospolita and explains that the transition to the yuan has become necessary for Russian business because of the sanctions.  gt This tendency is confirmed by a poll of the Kommersant newspaper quoted by Rzeczpospolita.  Since the beginning of the year the amount of funds in accounts in Chinese currency has increased approximately eightfold at Tinkoff Bank and fourfold at MTS Bank and Uralski Bank for Reconstruction and Development UBRD.  The same is happening at the St. Petersburg Bank where the number of these business accounts has almost 3.5fold and the number of contracts in Chinese currency has doubled.  gt Russian entrepreneurs are forced to trade in yuan.  The domestic currency is unstable and Western sanctions and Putin's decrees such as the one of March 5 prohibiting the repayment of liabilities to entities from the list of hostile countries in Western currencies make it difficult for entrepreneurs to do business with contractors abroad.  gt   China also has ambitions  at least in Asia  to dominate trade in its currency.  If you add to this the fact that the sanctions throw Moscow into the arms of Beijing's dependence the yuan will rather have a dominant role  confirmed in an interview with money.pl prof.  Dariusz Filar.  gt As Rzeczpospolita points out more Russian companies are betting on the yuan.  Among them are companies trading in spare parts textiles and food products.  The oil steel and mining industries are also starting to deal in Chinese currency.  According to the daily private Chinese companies are buying oil and coal from Russia for delivery in May and June.  gt Russia is falling more and more into the orbit of Chinese interests.  As we wrote in money.pl China is Russia's largest trading partner and although bilateral trade reached a new record of $ 147 billion last year these relations are very asymmetrical.  gt The strategic partnership between Russia and China brings more benefits to the Middle Kingdom than to Russia.  Russia is only the 15th export partner of the PRC.  In addition China has overtaken Russia in terms of trade with most Central Asian countries.  gt The situation is similar in the energy sector especially in the gas sector.  In 2014 after Russia's military intervention in Crimea when Russia received further economic sanctions from the European Union and was isolated in the West China after ten long years of negotiations suddenly decided to conclude a gas contract with it forcing the Kremlin to accept a low  delivery prices.

See previous DD  Most technical analysis techniques look at historical prices to divine future prices. This technical analysis focuses instead on the current Option Open Interest. In other words my crayons taste different.  Whenever the stock price blue touches the delta neutral line green and crosses back up it tends to go another 58.  I developed a tool which uses the entire open interest to calculate three important numbers  Delta Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option delta is 0.  Gamma Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is 0.  Gamma Maximum  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is the maximum.  The theory behind it is simple enough institutions tend to be the largest holders of short options contracts and are therefore obligated to hedge against those options contracts while collecting juicy premium riskfree.  By calculating similar numbers to what these institutions are dependent on I'm hoping to ride their coattails and earn tendies from their rounding errors.

Twitter is The Hindenburg  Elon is the Flame  You have not been paying close attention,Updatefollow up . There is no hostile takeover _is_doomed_there_is_no_hostile_takeover   Not financial advice Manage risk  I'm going to walk you through very methodically why Twitter is doomed and why Elon can't and won't save it with heavy DD. If anything he's a major catalyst to accelerate this process so I've taken the time to explain it here. I've categorized each section incase your brain is too smooth to understand one of the sections like the profit margins etc.  Also Elon's  Tweets today are ... well just look for yourself..   I keep getting comments about this  Twitter is already dead the institutions holding twitter hold it for heavy influence of the consumers. That stock and its financials don't mean much to them other than this. IMHOnfa  Gonna post this again at the top  gtTwitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules the company said in an unattributed statement. Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions. As always the statement added our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service. Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.  Yes I know it's a lie connect the dots it's easy.  ampx200B   Quick Recap Since April Fool's Day  ampx200B  Let's start here since this is undoubtedly where most of the smooth brains heard about this.  Elon took a 9.2 stake in twitter as reported  Mon Apr 4. while most of you were sleeping at 3 in the morning the stock gapped up 27 via 13G filing which is required for anyone who purchases more than 5 of a company. This publicly and officially discloses big ownership stakes.  When smooth brains heard this they thought 'wow Elon musk is in must be going to the moon' so they bought the top and pushed it up another few percent some smooth brains got out for tiny profit. Others got dumped on and got left holding the bag or sold for a loss because there was zero conviction or research into this play other than such stake much wow.  Some geniuses in this sub predicted it perfectly down to the timeline and price action how it would get dumped. Major congrats to you to being well versed in retard timelines and I hope you are still holding those puts because we've got a lot further to go down imo  ampx200B   Wendy's Laws of Tendies Applies  ampx200B  Should of simply applied  _wendys_laws_of_tendies  gt1st Law of Wendy's Mass stupidity. Assume everyone and you is retarded. The sooner you understand we are all natural born crayon eaters the sooner you are on the path to tendieland. Never trust anyone or yourself at first. If something seems retarded to you at first it's probably genius. The inverse is also true if you or others think it's genius at first glance it's probably retarded. Same thing if you see other people saying that. I don't care who they are. Do more research into it. Figure out how retarded everyone is so you can replace those crayon dinners with chicken feasts.  Now it's time to go one step further and apply  gt2nd Law of Wendy's Confusion. The more confusing and convoluted the information is the likelier it is you'll make big tendies. Big words and vocabulary you don't really understand means it's above your paygrade and therefore likely the opposite of retarded. Learn more about it and see if it's worth buying.   What Can Or Will Elon Do And What Can't or Won't He Do  ampx200B  I've seen a lot of next level retarded shit about Elon saving Twitter all over the internet.  Let's lay out the facts  1. Twitter is 77 owned by institutions  2. Elon is the 'single largest holder' but that doesn't mean much since you need 50.1  of a company to 'control it' 3. You cannot do a hostile take over of Twitter because of who owns it. 4. Twitter's Board in a statement put this out yes I know it's a lie they can control it point is they are not going to and they aren't there to make money directly off of TWTR  ampx200B  formatpjpgampautowebpamps52eb68361bde139f763d168655f4c0fe89d3766c  Meaning Twitter stock is worthless since the employees run the company and Elon doesn't get to decide shit. Same ownership. Same Management.  5. The CEO and the rest of the company doesn't believe in this stuff  gtParag Agrawal Our role is not to  be bound by the First Amendment but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation and our moves are reflective of things that we believe lead to a healthier public conversation. The kinds of things that we do to work about this is to focus less on thinking about free speech but thinking about how the times have changed. One of the changes today that we see is speech is easy on the internet. Most people can speak but our role which is particularly emphasized is who can be heard.  6. Elon is also capped at 14.8 ownership being a board member. But it doesn't matter because the 77 of the other institutions are not giving up their stakes. I'll get into that more later  Now that we laid out some facts lets talk about some implications of this  Elon cannot and will not change twitter in any meaningful way the company does not care about the share holders or even making money. They care about their activism. Ownership is onboard with this and is going to subsidize  like CNN etc. and continue running it in the direction that it has been going in. And even if they didn't a lot of the population will not ever trust TWTR again and a lot of the population esp on Twitter does not like Elon at all. Just look into that yourself if you don't believe me I know it's hard to believe  ampx200B   So what is the current direction of Twitter  Twitter is going down the tubes for a number of very important reasons.  ampx200B   Lets look at the financials and KPIs  First let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet  Starting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 _financials2020arFiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf  We can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue  1.37B Cost revenue  873M in 'Research and development'  888M in 'Sales and marketing'  562M in 'general and administrative'  Twitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.  Let's break this down again  Twitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent  37 on cost of revenue servers buildings upkeep etc.  23 on Research and development software engineers sociologists artists focus groups market research I believe moderators is in here as well  24 on Sales and marketing sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.  15 of general and administrative executives legal finance info tech hr consulting moderators in both categories probably customer service etc.  3 on interest and other interest on debt financing operations etc.  29 on taxes.  Yes these numbers add to 131 of revenue or in other words a 31 net income loss.  Why is Twitter so expensive to run why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money  Lets go back in time to Twitter in 20112013  Here's the same report from that time period. _financialsarTwitterInc2013AnnualReport.pdf  Page 57  Going to compare to Twitters Monthly active users MAU textAs20of20the20first20quarterdaily20active20users20mDAUdaily20active20users20mDAU.  2013 225M monthly active users MAU  Cost of Revenue  266 M 330M inflation adjusted  Research and Development.RampD 593M 740M inflation adjustedSales and Marketing 316M 400M inflation adjustedGeneral and Administrative 124M 160M inflation adjusted  2011 100M MAU  Cost of Revenue 62M 85M inflation adjusted  RampD 80M 110M inflation adjusted  Sales and marketing 26M 36M inflation adjusted  General and administrative 233M 310M inflation adjusted  Ok so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users  2020 330M MAU  Cost of revenue $4.15 per monthly active user  RampD $2.65 per monthly active user  Sales and marketing $2.7 per monthly active user  General and admin $1.7 per monthly active user  2013 225M monthly active users MAU numbers below adjusted for inflation  Cost of revenue $1.47 per monthly active user  RampD $3.29 per monthly active user  Sales and marketing $1.78 per monthly active user  General and admin $0.71 per monthly active user  2011 100M monthly active users MAU numbers below adjusted for inflation  Cost of revenue $0.85 per monthly active user  RampD $1.10 per monthly active user  Sales and marketing $0.36 per monthly active user  General and admin $0.85 per monthly active user  So what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.  Let's recap  Cost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15user in 2020 inflation adjusted 388 increase  RampD went from $1.10user in 2011 to $2.65user in 2020 inflation adjusted 141 increase  Sales and marketing went from $0.36user in 2011 to $2.70user in 2020 inflation adjusted 650 increase  And general and admin from $0.85user in 2011 to $1.70user in 2020 inflation adjusted 100 increase  As you can see twitter suffers from huge inflated costs over the years of running their business.  I suspect this has a lot to do with financing of their servers through amortization payments.  But also trying to scale their business with the technology that was available 10 years ago and not being able to change their business model because it was bad PR to fire off thousands people and replace them with future technology they've essentially been forced to grow with their existing business modeling scaling up which you can see results in worse and eventually negative margins.  Twitter has 5500 employees 1 employee for every 60000 users  This is one of the things they fear more is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare. by their other competitors I won't mention here just yet  Facebook has all of these similar issues with growing costs and declining growth etc.  More sources  Twitters growth is slowing and stagnant   As is their profitability    And ARPUActivity Engagement  14B in Total Assets  6.7B in Total Liabilities  Net income is negative and historical trends are horrible    FCF does not look great either  Also considering censorship is Twitters product what userbase is left after that . Besides they never did anything wrong why admit that now to change it if profit is not a motive  All down the tubes. Ownership does not care employees do not care. Twitter is not about making money to them and it never will be imo  ampx200B   Why is Elon there then He's not stupid  ampx200B  You are completely right about Elon. But understand that Elon's net worth is near 300B and this is a troll purchase to him. Advertisement for his products and entertainment. He knows exactly what he is doing. The employees there are already revolting  Get it  ampx200B  formatpjpgampautowebpampsf4178e80678e2d341f15ea439afb97507ff08246  ampx200B  Twitter is taking since last year to roll out a simple edit button  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampsb8d15d2926b42a79df9ab6c17809e0416998a56e  ampx200B   TLDR  ampx200B  Twitter r Fuk. 1st and 2nd Law of Wendy's applies here. Elon can't and wont be saving shit even if he wants to I've got even more DD about that and Twitters competitors but I won't mention it here for now  Even if it does change the userbase and employees will revolt even more than they already are.

The force of retard is strong in retail in this one. I've seen smoothers say TWTR is the next amazon and that Elon is doing a hostile takeover.  Also Institutional money has a lot vested to prop them up.  Good luck  gt3rd Law of Wendy's Diamond Hands. If you're betting around short term small movement you're going to paper hand or miss out. The best things can be volatile or daunting before doing the research. The payout has to be worth the risk otherwise you'll lose out over time even if you win more often.

Calling all dividend investors  Stop making investment decisions based on high dividend yields A good chunk of them are whats called a yield trap Only relying on dividend yield percentage is a good way to get a dividend cut,Calling all dividend investors   Stop making investment decisions based on high dividend yields   A good chunk of them are what's called a yield trap  Only relying on dividend yield percentage is a good way to get a dividend cut.  Few people realize this until the dividend gets cut and it's too late.  I look for businesses that will continue to pay dividends raise those dividends higher than inflation and they have growth divers that will increase their share price.  Stay away from high dividend yields.   gt Find out why the company has such a high dividend yield before considering it.   gt Yields that appear unrealistically high often end up being suspended or cut leaving investors who bought the stock just for the dividend disappointed.,negative

Continue to accumulate $PAA units or open the $12$17 January 2024 Call Spread,Below my comments lies a quote from an SA article today written by Samuel Smith. It independently confirms my previous posts for those that were hesitant.  This is not an overnight  to the moon.   This will be a gradual climb but well worth the wait.  For those interested my top 7 holdings are as follows  1 $PAA  2 $ET  3 $NCLH until $25 then Ill sellthats post dilution fair value in my opinion 4 $C  5 $T received WBD shares today 6 $DIS 7 $VSCO  Other positions include $LEVI $VFH $KTB $EAT $VFC $FL these are all very undervalued cash flow amp sales growth positive companies.  While I dont have positions yet I dont hate $FB or $PYPL here.    1. Plains All American Pipeline NASDAQPAA  PAA's strength lies in its welllocated midstream energy infrastructure in the lowestcost U.S. shale basin Permian Basin. In fact it has such substantial scale and strategic positioning in the Permian Basin that Morningstar speculates that  It's not much of a stretch to state that there is a high probability that in some fashion Plains touches every barrel of oil the Permian produces earning a fee if not multiple fees.  While weakness in volumes from the basin relative to supply of infrastructure has led to poor financial results for PAA in recent years demand is beginning to recover in the basin and we expect PAA to be a big beneficiary of this trend.   Wall Street analysts seems to agree with consensus estimates for distributable cash per unit expected to improve at a 7.9 CAGR over the next half decade despite growth capital expenditures set to decline to a mere $275 million in 2022 down from $950 million in 2020.  Management is allocating the extra free cash flow primarily towards paying down debt in an effort to further strengthen its investment grade standing and set the business up to better weather any future downcycles like it experienced in 2020.  Additionally PAA has been allocating free cash flow towards equity unit repurchases  accelerating its buyback pace in Q4  and is also growing its distribution at a brisk pace just hiked its quarterly distribution by 20.8 in an effort to restore it to its precut level.   With an expected 2022 free cash flow level of $1.3 billion PAA currently offers a mouthwatering 16.5 free cash flow yield that covers its recently increased distribution by more than two times.   This  when combined with expectations of strong perunit distributable cash flow growth over the next half decade  will enable PAA to deleverage grow its distribution and buy back units at a very solid clip and should lead to outsized total returns for unitholders. ,positive
NOK to the moon,I had a dream last night that I was explaining my online trading account to my brother. Everything was in the red so it was pretty realistic and I started scrolling down my portfollio showing him some of the stocks I own.  I then got to NOK. And as we looked at it it went up to $20. I said that's unusual for a stock to go up that much in just a short time and no sooner had the words left my mouth did it go to $40. And then I got interested and it went to $80. So I was buying like a fucking tramp on chips and it went all the way to $254. Stayed around the $250 mark for a couple of minutes and then went back down to about $116 before eventually going all the way back to the start I obviously did not sell in time.  Anyway. I'm not sure of the exact time this took place so I've gone and bought shares off the back of it  937  5.33  Admittedly this isn't the best DD you'll ever read. Equally though it's not the worst.  If you need to tell me this is not financial advice then God help you.,positive
Can Elon Musk purchase another 11 of Twitter in the NEAR future 11  9  Twitter board control pls any SEC rules gurus,This might be a relatively long post but I've been looking at Delaware law and various other information sources related to this entire Elon amp Twitter thing. Some of this post is going to be statements and the rest is questions. I'm really hoping I can find some SEC guru that can point me in the right direction because I have questions but don't know how to google them lol. Sorry if it sounds like I don't really know what I'm talking about because honestly I don't but I would really like some insight from people who do.  ampx200B  This document here was signed by both the CEO of Twitter Parag Agrawal and Elon Musk. It states the following  1. Elon will become a board member. 2. Elon cannot purchase more than 14.9 of Twitter. 3. This document falls under Delaware law.  So my takeaway here is this document holds significance because it limits Elon from acquiring more than 14.9 of Twitter. From here I went to figure out why 14.9 is significant this is what I found.  This document here CTRL  F gt 15 says the following  1.  These provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.  2.  As a Delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law including Section203 of the Delaware General Corporation law which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least twothirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such 15 or greater stockholder.  3. There's a lot more it's just too much to copy paste here.  My takeaway from this is you cannot own 14.9 rule is they're trying to prevent him from pushing for a hostile takeover. My next question was what percentage ownership do you need to force the board to listen to you this is what I found.  This document here CTRL  F gt 20 says the following  1.  4 Control including the terms controlling controlled by and under common control with means the possession directly or indirectly of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person whether through the ownership of voting stock by contract or otherwise. A person who is the owner of 20 or more of the outstanding voting stock of any corporation partnership unincorporated association or other entity shall be presumed to have control of such entity in the absence of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary Notwithstanding the foregoing a presumption of control shall not apply where such person holds voting stock in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this section as an agent bank broker nominee custodian or trustee for 1 or more owners who do not individually or as a group have control of such entity.  2. There's a lot more it's just too much to copy paste here.  My takeaway from this is that if Elon is able to get 20 of Twitter he has control over the board and they need to listen to what he says. Now a recap on what's happened in the recent days.  Elon originally started acquiring Twitter shares starting 1312022 and recently announced his position whether he did this abiding by all of the SEC rules is debatable but not the point. Right after this information came out both the current and previous CEO of Twitter made public posts welcoming Elon to the board and saying he'll be a great addition to the team. However late last night apparently Elon had a change of heart and completely went back on the contract he signed this one from above. This part is speculation but maybe Elon approached the board and said I want changes made to the way you guys handle censorship then they told him no. If Elon backs out of an agreement that basically only says one thing you cannot have more than 14.9 then wouldn't that imply he has intentions of acquiring more than 14.9 And if he's going to go for 14.9 wouldn't he just go for 20 so he has control over the board   There was a tweet Elon made saying something along the lines of expect significant improvements to Twitter in the coming months. In order for someone to make changes to the platform he would need 1 of 2 things or both.  1. A board seat which he declined. 2. 20 ownership.  All signs seem to point towards Elon buying another 11 granting him power over the board forcing them to listen to him.   The questions that I wasn't able to figure out on my own are as follows  1. Are there any SEC rules that prohibit Elon from selling the 9.1 he recently purchased in the near future Wouldn't him selling now be a deliberate pump and dump How would he be punished if he did this He knew that his purchase would increase the stock value it sounds like textbook price manipulation to just flip sides and sell now. 2. Are there any SEC rules that prohibit Elon from purchasing another 11 in the NEAR future. I understand he'll be able to buy more shares going forward now that he's voided the contract he had with Twitter but is there a time limit after just recently buying the 9.1  I tried to find the answers to these questions but I have no idea where to look. Really hoping there's some SEC guru around that can provide some insight here.,negative

I tried to warn about this as soon as I heard the news but WSB didn't let me post because I am so new here. I think this is the last chance to hop on board before it's mooning to euphoric rates.

Elon is starting to unload his $TWTR position. Time to buy puts.,Ive got $46 weekly Puts  There were two huge sell orders that executed simultaneously today after hours.  Each one for 1105885 shares.  Out of sheer curiuosioty I went through Elons 13D because it listed all of the buy orders hes made since January.

$BBAI. The story of a bear that hates it's own kind,I'm a straight shooter so I'll add TLDR first.  TLDR I believe BBAI to have a reduced float of 1 million shares and a short interest of 900 thousand. And is ripe for short andor gamma squeeze.   REDUCED FLOAT  If you check the float online the number you'll get is just over 12 million shares. THIS IS WRONG  Let's first start with total outstanding shares. Which is 135566227 shares according to the latest s1A filing. Image below is from page 73  formatpngampautowebpamps4aef4d74336ac0944e3eb3d991afb093e0837957  Of these 135 million shares 124564920 shares are locked for one year from date of consummation of merger. Which was December 7th 2021. So this means these 124 million shares are locked until DECEMBER 7th 2022 or till price stays above 12.50 20 out 30 days. We are still in April and price hasn't met the 20 out of 30 condition either far from it.  formatpngampautowebpampse49805f3be0b89a10e6b87991b5db96b07997904  Quick maths.  135566227124564920 11001307  proofformatpngampautowebpamps2e18b0618612b8a1ebe91c2ddc79d4a22acc9178  Out of the 11 million shares about 9.9 million was owned by three entities.

A high utilization means a crowded short right Meaning a bunch of people are shorting a stock.  But why is utilization so low for BBAI Well check out cost to borrow costs. They go as high as 900. That's SST range and that went as high as 37 dollars this past week. Also a locked float situation  Try as an experiment to short a share of BBAI. You won't be able to find a share to short. The stock is that illiquid. That's why I believe once this goes parabolic it's gonna go go. Cause no one in their right mind is paying 100s of percent trying to borrow shares to short.  formatpngampautowebpamps0158ddb679812fa006e4095bafe43123da785e1d  Found this on twitter formatpngampautowebpampsce23f361cc47dd17b11ef47764dde3416864693d   POSITIONS  130 April 10s  38 April 15s  Special thanks to alilfishy for bringing it to my attention.,negative

By Rep. Earl Blumenauer DOR  After working on cannabis reform for decades we hit another critical threshold Congress passed both the comprehensive MORE Act which is the gold standard in cannabis reform and my Medical Marijuana Research Act.    Make no mistake. The reason we are at this moment and poised to end the tragic unfair and misguided prohibition on cannabis is because the people got there first. Thirtyeight states have enacted medical marijuana and 18 states have determined that adult use should be legal. In total 98 percent of the population has access to some form of legalized cannabis because at the state level the fact that over twothirds of the public favor full legalization matters. While the federal government isnt there yet that too is changing.  The Senate can put these pieces inline with each other  banking comprehensive reform and research.,positive

Russian Palladium Refiners banned by London's Platinum and Palladium Market and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange SBSW and other nonRussian Palladium companies stand to gain massively,On Friday the London Platinum and Palladium Market a major trading venue for Palladium and other platinum group metals banned two major Russian state owned Palladium refineries from having their Palladium and Platinum sold on the LPPM's London and Zurich exchanges This was followed up by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also banning the same Russian state owned refiners today Additionally the Japanese Exchange Group's Osaka exchange is now also reviewing whether or not to ban Russian Palladium and Platinum refiners. This has major implications in the Palladium market as Russia produces about 40 of the world's Palladium. Russia's Palladium and Platinum exports were one of the very last major Russian exports left that were not subject to any major sanctions. As civilian deaths mount in the RussoUkrainian War more and more pressure will mount on Western governments and financial regulators to cut Russia further out of the world markets. Any removal of Russian palladium from the world market gives an excellent opportunity for nonRussian Palladium producers to profit. Aside from Russia major palladium mines are located in South Africa the United States and Canada. Palladium is used heavily in both the car industry and electronics industry being used in both catalytic converters and integrated circuits. If major automakers and chip makers are no longer allowed to buy Russian Palladium they will be all forced to compete for Palladium produced by companies like Sibanye Stillwater SBSW which controls nearly all of American Palladium mining production and has major mines in South Africa and Impala Platinum Holdings JSE IMP which has major Canadian and South African mines.    I am long 400 shares of SBSW.,negative
Short Strangle Wheel option strategy idea,   tldr  Wheel but you also have 100 shares of the underlying and sell Covered calls along with the Cash secured puts.  So there are many ways to describe this strategy and I don't know if others have already come up with it they probably have but I wanted to know your guys opinion on it and what you think some issues might be. It is essentially a short strangle but you own shares of the underlying and wheel it. So with the usual wheel strategy you sell cash secured puts and generate premium from that and then when assigned sell covered calls above the basis you got assigned on the puts and if its a bullish stock it will eventually pay out. This strategy works similarly except you buy 100 shares of the underlying and sell both OTM calls and OTM puts This way you can profit if the stocks go up or stays even. If you get assigned on your call its above what you bought the shares for so you make profit along with the puts you sold that expire worthless. If the stock stays between the 2 strikes it will act similarly to a iron condor and you just get to keep the premium. If you get assigned on the puts you just buy more shares of the underlying which dollar cost averages your initial shares meaning you can sell more covered calls at a lower basis to breakeven and make profit. Essentially its the wheel but you benefit if the stock stays the same and goes up but if the stock goes down it just DCAs your shares. As long as its a bullish stock and you have enough capital you can just keep dollar cost averaging your way down and the stock would have to rebound a minimal amount for you to still make profit on the shares and you keep all the premium you farmed a long the way from either side. I'm sure there is probably something I have forgotten about or not taken account so please leave your thoughts in the comments.,positive

GOGO is Going to GOGO to the Moon  SampP SmallCap 600 Index Inclusion Will Squeeze the Near 40 Float Shorted Stock,We're Going to GOGO to the Moon  GOGO which is based in Chicago is an inflight internet company that provides broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market.  GOGO is currently working on launching Gogo5G which will deliver 25 Mbps on average with peak speeds in the 7580 Mbps range.  The Why  GOGO is one of the highest shorted stocks with 37.15 of the float sold short. Now you may wonder why this is relevant well it's because GOGO is looking to break through the $20 resistance where it can move up without much technical resistance and it has all the right factors going for it.  The How  GOGO is already up 87 this year and the shorts have been suffering heavily. This is the perfect moment for their positions to collapse. As the shorts will already be looking to derisk in the current market environment it gives the stock an even bigger momentum push.  Speaking about the market GOGO has been going up against it and is green during red days. It's showing what we like to call regard strength.  The Fundamental amp Technical  1. It was recently added to the SampP SmallCap 600 Index so the passive investors are all buying. This is supported by the fact that volume has exploded since. 2. Traders are buying in due to momentum and the high short percentage. Supported by the chart and volume as well. 3. It's currently testing levels not seen since 2015.  The Hypothesis  In my opinion $40 is easily achievable in the short term under the current dynamics and the fundamentalstechnicals. The chart looks like it is ready for a parabolic move.  The Position  GOGO 5202022 $20.00 CALL. Still cheap due to low IV and gives me a month for the breakout to occur. Any positive market day could cause it. it's also pumping today during a fear day which is a great sign.  TLDR GOGO recently added to SampP SmallCap 600 Index momentum is going to cause covering by the high short percentage.  Ape TLDR GOGO TO THE MOON,positive

Walmart's online retail business is growing steadily and will continue to regain share from Amazon.   Stagflation and skyrocketing food prices will further drive sales. People who'd formerly turn up their nose at Walmart and opt for Target can no longer afford to pass over the savings to be had.

DD CNHI is my high conviction play,Listen up apes I got a play for you. Get out your crayons and take notes.  The stock I am going to introduce you to is CNHI. Many of you may know it as a boring tractor company. But step aside Ryan Cohen a new big daddy CEO is in town.  Scott Wine took over as CEO in January of last year and has already placed an Insider Buy for over 3 million worth of stock. He has split up CNHI so that they focus more purely on agriculture now making them a more agile company.  The most exciting part for me is that they just acquired Raven Industries for a bit over $2 billion. This makes them a contender in the high growth high profit margin industry that is autonomous driving tractors and other high tech ag equipment. They are becoming Deere but without the lawsuits or overpriced stock. To double down on this investment they announced 18 days ago that they are going to be building an advanced engineering center in Nevada USA in order to further propel their high tech farming advancements as well as attract talent to come work for them.  Scott Wine is the former CEO of Polaris and he absolutely transformed that company and exploded the stock. Just look I got my crayons out for you guys. The red circle is when Scott Wine took over in 2008. He took Polaris and made it into a global company imagine what he can do to CNHI.  ampx200B  formatpjpgampautowebpampsb0735c5eacc8fc522dd994dec12d9c2b28ffacdf  To be honest I am getting tired of doing DD If you can even call this that so I'll make this even briefer than I had planned and just spit some other factors that I am bullish about real quick. Ill also tag on some pictures.  CNHI is cheap compared to peers 11.74 pe such as Deere 23.19 and CAT 18.35 and even shitty Kubota 13.7 is more expensive  CNHI beats all recent earnings calls like crazy  Q1 2021 beat EPS by 128  Q2 2021  beat EPS by 57.46  Q3 2021  beat eps by 70.62  Q4 2021  beat eps by 19.48   Revenue were also all positives but I'm too lazy to type those all out look it up yourself.  Coincidently I saw a big ass Case tractor on the way home today and boy did it look sexy. I think this is a sign to buy.  Also this nice little picture shows you how it just bounced off the support line and is about to go up to the MOON  ampx200B  formatpjpgampautowebpampsfaa91378f7ca62f54150ad56c9cd3b9b537625b9  Also go to raven industries site  Raven Industries  Raven Industries  you will be impressed. CNHI is doing just as much cool stuff as Deere but it's not priced in yet. We are on the verge of an agriculture revolution and CNHI is poised to take the main stage.  Positions I lost most of my fun money gambling on HMHC sad face so I have to play it safer on this one since I cant afford to lose my savings. If you guys give me more DD and conformation bias then screw it Ill get more options. Currently I hold 110 shares 1 520 $15 call 1 617 $15 call.  If I had money to blow I'd buy the shit out of May or June $17.5 calls. Earnings will be May 3 and I expect it to move fast after another earning beats.  This is not financial advice I am probably more smoothed brained than most of you. This is a company that's in the same industry that I work in and I have a good feeling about it.,positive

Blackstone BX looking good for a repeat performance.,TLDR BX June 130C for $2.60 or less.

See previous DD  Most technical analysis techniques look at historical prices to divine future prices. This technical analysis focuses instead on the current Option Open Interest. In other words my crayons taste different.  Whenever the stock price blue touches the delta neutral line green and crosses back up it tends to go another 58.  I developed a tool which uses the entire open interest to calculate three important numbers  Delta Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option delta is 0.  Gamma Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is 0.  Gamma Maximum  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is the maximum.  The theory behind it is simple enough institutions tend to be the largest holders of short options contracts and are therefore obligated to hedge against those options contracts while collecting juicy premium riskfree.  By calculating similar numbers to what these institutions are dependent on I'm hoping to ride their coattails and earn tendies from their rounding errors.  Positions   BX  June 130C at $2.16  Will buy when market opens. Targeting to pay less than $2.60share for the contracts.,positive

Making Bank Using Leverage and Options I promise its not as bad as it sounds, If You Had To Point Out The Flaws Of The Stock Market Relative To Other Asset Classes What Would They Be  Theres a long list of them high volatility sequence of return risk low cashflow high efficiency and liquidity this could be a pro or con depending on how you look at it lack of significant leverage etc.  Out of all those things however were gonna focus on two of them. The lack of cashflow and the lack of leverage. Both of these things are abundant in real estate in particular. A good rental multifamily can be expected to have a cap rate of 712 with a cash on cash return ideally around 15 or higher. This is because 1 real estate does not rely upon appreciation solely it relies upon the income it generates from the renters and 2 investment properties typically only need a 20 down payment in order to purchase.  Thats a 51 leverage ratio which would be impossible to achieve safely in the stock market.  Now it used to be that stocks had lower appreciation and higher dividend yields however that has not been the case for 70 years at least.  You can take a look at this dividend yield chart of the SampP 500 for reference.  formatpngampautowebpampsc4d2968767da41b9c7914a3b2fb641edbc6d10de   Luckily We Can Turn The Stock Market Back Into An Income Machine Using Options  This is the whole premise of the thetagang position. We replace our stock appreciation with premiums received from selling options as a sort of dividend yield.  So we turn to selling puts and calls on SPX or SPY or whatever index you prefer. Thats great but if we compare it back to real estate were still missing the essential component of leverage.  Thats where leveraged ETFs come in.  The pros and cons of LEFTs have been hotly debated but what settled it for me personally was this post by hedgefundie and this article about volatility decay If you don't want to read through all of that I've condensed down the important stuff regarding volatility decay and proper diversification in this postswamputm_campaignpostamputm_mediumweb. But basically assuming it works perhaps we can change it from capital appreciation to income generation using options.  Surely that should work right  Well it should if we do it correctly to avoid assignment as much as possible.  Leveraged ETFs suffer from something called volatility decay basically just describing the idea that a when a loss is incurred a greater gain needs to be made to square ourselves back to zero. With leverage we magnify our risk to this factor.  So because we have more vulnerability to downside lets protect ourselves using a bit of probability.   Using Standard Deviation To Calculate Probabilities  Lets just assume for the moment that all market movements are as good as being random. Yes they are based on data but if we dont have access to said data the movements may as well be random.  Under this assumption we can then also assume that there are probabilities to which direction a stock is going to move. There should be roughly a 50 chance that the stock will go up or down at any given moment.  On top of that we could also assume that larger movements are less likely than smaller movements mainly due to the fact that it takes much larger sudden inflows and outflows of cash to make a stock behave that way. Now some stocks have a relatively higher ability to make a significant move in either direction but even these stocks still have boundaries where they will be unlikely to move.  A good example of this how wild Teslas swings are relative to General Electric. Tesla has a higher relative swing compared to General Electric but even Tesla is unlikely to swing to $30 or $5000 in the next year.  Now these observations we just made are the fundamental ideas behind the concept of standard deviation.  Standard deviation essentially says that within a given time frame usually a year a stock has a certain probability of being within certain price ranges based on its volatility its ability to make wild swings like Tesla.  formatpngampautowebpampsad20b147792f9eb6d33617c18bd6d4722b526bc9  As you can see at the bottom of the chart we see that at each increasing or decreasing standard deviation 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 etc there is less of a probability that our data or in this case the stock price will fall into this range given a normal distribution.  If you add up all the percentages between 1 and 1 we get a 68.2 chance that our stock price will fall in this range. This is called the first standard deviation. If we expand out the 2 and 2 then we get a 95.4 chance that our stock price will fall within the range. That is called the second standard deviation. If we go out to the 3 on each side we get a 98.8 chance that the stock price will fall within the range. With each standard deviation the chance that a stock price will fall within the range gets higher albeit at a much slower rate.   So What Does This Have To Do With Selling Options  Using these standard deviations we can get probabilities that a stock will fall within a certain range. If we use something called Implied Volatility we can figure out what the market thinks that one standard deviation is. Then using that we can predict what probability our option has of expiring in the money which is what we dont want.  To find implied volatility we can go to a website like volafy.net and get the implied volatility percentage. In the case of TQQQ QQQ leveraged 3x the implied volatility is 80 at this time of writing.  Using this percentage we can plug it into a handy formula to calculate the standard deviation for any specific option.  The formula looks like this  sqrtoption days until expiration365  implied volatility  current stock price  In written terms basically we divide the days until expiration by 365 then take the square root of that and multiply it by the implied volatility percentage and the current stock price.  That gives us the amount in dollars of the first standard deviation. If you take that amount and add it AND subtract it from the current price it will give you the range the stock will fall within 68 of the time.  Right now we are interested in selling puts on TQQQ without getting exercised so well sell at one standard deviation out of the money. At the current price of TQQQ $51.84 the first standard deviation out of the money would be $38.11 which is also 51.84  13.73.  If we go back up to our standard deviation chart we can see that on the left side of the chart the side that represents our OTM options we can add up all the percentages before the 1st standard deviation mark. This comes out to be a 15.9 that our OTM option will become ITM by expiration you might have noticed that this percentage closely correlates with the delta of the option which is a good way to gauge it as well. If we are selling monthly options this comes out to be getting assigned once out of every six months on average. To me those seem like pretty good odds.  So lets go down to the $38 strike put on TQQQ which is trading $128 per contract right now. Thats a 3.37 ROI in 40 days or 30.75 annually.  If we assume assignment three times a year that wipes out any premiums made for that given month we are still sitting on a 20.64 CAGR.   But Wait Isnt This Riskier Than Selling Puts On Regular Old QQQ  This is the beauty of it you have the same risk of getting assigned on TQQQ as you do with QQQ if you stay at the same standard deviation but still receive 3x the premium. This is because with TQQQ higher volatility we sell further OTM than we would with regular QQQ but still receive the high premiums due to it being a leveraged product.  If you do happen to get assigned no worries Personally I would recommend that you simply just sell out of the position at the current price and open a new put for the next month. The reason why I say this as opposed to selling a call is that calls do not have the same volatility risk premium that puts do and therefore do not sell for as much. If you want to read more there is this paperreprep1amptypepdf which discusses the outperformance of a put writing only strategy that outperforms during bearflat markets. If you open a new put you are simply taking the loss for that month with the intention that the high win rate probability of this trading strategy will make you square again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS STRATEGY ON ANYTHING BESIDES INDEXES if you do chances are that eventually that stock will get wiped out and never recover I'm looking at you TLRY. Indexes on the other hand do recover you don't need to look any further than this chart to prove it.

NOK to the moon,I had a dream last night that I was explaining my online trading account to my brother. Everything was in the red so it was pretty realistic and I started scrolling down my portfollio showing him some of the stocks I own.  I then got to NOK. And as we looked at it it went up to $20. I said that's unusual for a stock to go up that much in just a short time and no sooner had the words left my mouth did it go to $40. And then I got interested and it went to $80. So I was buying like a fucking tramp on chips and it went all the way to $254. Stayed around the $250 mark for a couple of minutes and then went back down to about $116 before eventually going all the way back to the start I obviously did not sell in time.  Anyway. I'm not sure of the exact time this took place so I've gone and bought shares off the back of it  937  5.33  Admittedly this isn't the best DD you'll ever read. Equally though it's not the worst.

SPY week 15,The Spy Friday rose as a phenomenal rate and I think it was more than just volume.  Before trading hours we saw the SPY dropping at a remarkable rate.

How does everyone feel about the week on SPY Is it a PUT or Call week  Currently the SPY is 442.07,negative

$SPY  Predictions for the week of 411,Last week I said that SPY was going to slope down with nothing crazy that happened except my 5 day forecast got inversed.  The days that I thought would be bearish were actually bullish.    I was thinking about this and noticed how there is hundreds of ways the week could play out  that would result in SPY going down.    I am still going to continue the 5 Day Outlook because it is something funny to do just take it with a grain of salt because it is seriously impossible to predict every single day before the futures market even opens... I write these Saturday morning.    ampx200B  1 Day Chartformatpngampautowebpamps27e05d57d4deb60529bae70e73e6937f820f3fa2  The main levels have been the same for about a month now  Support 432  Resistance 452  The RSI is showing the K approaching an oversold reading there will at least be a short term relief in the selling pressure overall  1 Day Chartformatpngampautowebpamps590c166936580732ddbcfe55540e897b0827817c  I would classify the bollinger band with as a somewhat mean reverting indicator to get a sense of the overall volatility.  Since the bollinger bands have a relative wide span we can assume that we will likely be entering a phase of lower volatility.    ampx200B  CPI Data Release Dateformatpngampautowebpamps5317e8515c102614e5d3e4562d01e737d38e4a72  Everyone is going to be watching the CPI data when it is released on Tuesday.  Remember that Ukraine was invaded February 24th so all of the effects on the global markets were felt last month in March.    All retail investors will be watching and all of Wall Street will be watching.  This is not going to be pretty...

There is nothing to be done now I am just waiting.  I still have a lot of positions open when this crash starts I will start to liquidate everything... believe me it will be very noticeable when it starts.   ampx200B  Federal Reserve FOMC statementformatpngampautowebpamps12b1e18659efc463475d55f038f17d0baf6db894  Bullard is concerned for the economy and wants at least a 50 to 75bp rate hike.  I actually found this kind of interesting because he is one of the least corrupt people in office.  He has a net worth around 5 million which is surprisingly low for having inside information.  He also has never worked with big banks and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.  He definitely knows what is going on and what needs to be done to save the economy.  The federal reserve will eventually have to become more aggressive in rate hikes.  ampx200B  Crude Oil CFDsformatpngampautowebpampsd943fa66e23d9a16dc6745f34c4e1246e88f48dd  Predictions  Tuesday is going to be an extremely important day.  I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10.  Oil rose 35 in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5 which is going to shock the markets.    Another factor is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.    The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.  I hate to be that person but over the last year with unemployment decreasing spending increasing and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80 without interfering.  At most there will be a 50 bear market similar to 2008.  The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell then it should recover in the following days.    Not professional financial advice do not solely make your trades based on my opinions I encourage everyone to research more   TLDR  formatpngampautowebpamps39172bb2a032402fe4c78d52443440fff4a1a227  I will respond to every comment,negative

Statistical approche of trading options,   My idea is simple and u just need office 365 at least it's more comfortable that way.  1. I get every available daily last price for a ticker. 2. For every day I calculate how a trade would have performed if I would have held for x Days x is the count of days till expiration 3. I choose how far away from the money I want to trade depends on the strategy 4. I divide the number of trades that would have gone in your favor by the number of total trades 5. Done  Example for my current position in $WFC  Setup  I sold a put option with expiration on April 14.  3 DTE with a strike of 46.50$   Currently the stock is 56 above my strike.  Statistics 1   Within the past 6888 trading days $WFC dropped by 56 in 3 Days 280 times   2806888 is 407  gt The statistical chance of being assigned is therefore this exact 407  Delta is currently 0.168. for me that is overvalued although i know about earnings call at Friday  Statistics 2  WFC had it's last high on March 22 which are 17 DTE until 14.4.. At this day the high was 54.18$.  The distance to my strike is therefore 1417.  WFC has fallen by 1417 within 17 days 146 times.  1466888  212  That makes a 212 Chance of getting assigned.  I know things are not necessarily so simple but without special events this is a good statistical edge you can get.,positive

Gapped up and gapped down stocks  good strategy potential, Does anyone here currently use after market gap analysis to identify stock likely to shift dramatically on market next day open  Here's the basics   Gapping occurs when the price of a stock or another asset opens above or below the previous day's close with no trading activity in between. A gap is the area discontinuity in a security's price chart. Gaps may materialize when headlines cause market fundamentals to change rapidly during hours when markets are typically closed for instance the result of an earnings call afterhours.  Gapping may also refer to the difference or spread in rates at which banks borrow and lend. The dynamic gap measures how assets money held and liabilities money loaned change over time.  Here's a good example from last week  HP Inc NYSE HPQ stock price gapped up 18.6 after Warren Buffett revealed that Berkshire Hathaway had acquired 121 million shares.  This lead to this early jump in price  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps99ec8ea9b665f008f2a57cbfc85a9183636d0cec     You can use sites such as barchart.com to run gap up and gap down stock analysis to identify potential targets for profits out of the gates on markets open.  More often that not a gapup will encourage a 'buy' and gapdown will encourage a 'sell'.  However you need to gauge the momentum behind the stock and trend to decide what is the appropriate strategy to deploy however as a simple start point gap circumstances can roughly be categorised as such  1. A breakaway gap Sell short and place a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. 2. An exhaustion gap  prices pull back into it the next day The downtrend is over Cover shorts immediately. 3. Another exhaustion gap marked by a lack of new highs after the gap Several days of churning offer good shorting opportunities with a stop above the high. 4. A continuation gap in a downtrend Go short with a stop a few ticks above the gaps upper rim. Prices hit that stop a few days later  no method is failsafe. 5. An exhaustion gap closed two days after it opened Cover shorts immediately. 6. A common gap in the midst of a congestion area closed the next day No action recommended. 7. A breakaway gap Go long and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. 8. A continuation gap Add to longs and place a protective stop a few ticks below the gaps lower rim. The gap at the right edge of the chart could be either a continuation or an exhaustion gap. Relatively quiet volume suggests continuation. If you buy place a protective stop a few ticks below the lower rim of this gap.  In the HP example above this was a breakaway gap with sufficient indicator and fundamental analysis to tell you this was a 'BUY'.  In any case a good solid strategy to nail down and add to the arsenal.,positive

This guy wont take delivery of his egg future contracts. What to do shitpost,So I've done some work for the poultry industry in the past.  Because of the bird flu scare they wanted to unload a ton of eggs quickly at cut rate costs.  They reached out to me because they know I am on WSB and do some day trading.  I saw this opportunity and agreed to sell some futures contracts.  I ended up selling the agreed upon allotment of DCE JD contracts. Fresh Hen Egg Futures.  Turns out I probably could have sold those contracts for way more than I did but we farmers and I wanted to make sure the eggs would move before they went bad.  I only took a 5 cut and the rest goes to the farmers so every contract sold did ok.  If we held out a little longer we could've cleared at least another 20 or more.  Needless to say the farmers have had to massacre their chicken stocks because of the bird flu.  So this one guy that we sold some contracts to wanted more.  Despite being over capacity the farmers wanted to sell more to make up for the fact they were making less per egg.  The farmers coop accepted his contract offers and we'd make more eggs.  This meant all of us myself the farmers and their kids etc. would have to put in the OT to make sure we filled this order.       Now the buyer of the contracts is saying he was messed up when he bought the contracts and cant take physical delivery of the final 10 contracts because of the size of his storage location.  A contract is 5 metric TONS of eggs.  A tonne of eggs is anywhere between 1086 and 1736 dozens of eggs.  In total we are talking about over 1 million eggs.  How do you buy a contract and not know that you do not have appropriate storage let alone 10 contracts  Also for reference a chicken will lay one egg per day if youre lucky.  To fill this over sized order we were sitting there jacking off roosters for a week straight to get all of the chicken jizz and then had to finger every hen to knock them up to get the eggs made.  If you turn on a black light in my place you'd go blind and I have a few roosters following me around and sending me chocolates and flowers.     What should I do  I need this guy to take the damn eggs.,negative

This is a blessing in disguise but Im stupid like the rest of yall,Ok look  I know yall are a bunch of autist who only care about tomorrows price action but listen . Yall are getting another chance to buy the stocks you love at amazing discounts . Buying nvidia for less than 250  AMD under 100 FB under 250 and Netflix under 350 Shit disney under 150 These are amazing steals  in my opinion  Like yall fucking bitch and complain about Oh shit I was too late and now this stock is up too damn much or something .   HERES MY PERSONAL experience  Last year when we were talking about if inflation would be bad amd dropped to around 8085 bucks for a long time and I did nothing   then i saw it rip to 160 ish and felt like shit for not buying it around 8085 . OR heres a better one  rblx after its first run to 100 came back down and was sideways at 7080 for a while before running to 140  I again regretted not buying then and now  here it is under 50 .   Now go back to your shitty memories  not your wedding day   Im meaning the feeling of ahh shit i missed out on that rally .   NoW yall see the second part of the title  I think we will probabaly drop more  granted idk how much more could just be a few  or a fuck ton  either way  im waitng for a bigger drop and if I miss the exact bottom  I just hope I catch the rally early on before I completely miss out . Is this a stupid idea ... only time will tell but best believe I have limits set . Like if rblx crosses 60 Im dumping cash in it  if nvidida hits 250 im buying in no matter what . Because fuck me if i miss the bottom but i wont miss the rally .   I am not a financial advisor and nothing is financial advise .,negative

Im still regretting the choices that lead me to buying HMHC calls but this one seems less like a scam because I didnt read about it from any of you degenerates.

Blackstone BX looking good for a repeat performance.,TLDR BX June 130C for $2.60 or less. Exit the trade when BX hits $130 or in three weeks.  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps2498f6f5c9f51d043e76d7a2e4c9b2e1a2ff9ec0  It looks like BX is primed to once again hit a technical rally. See previous DD  Most technical analysis techniques look at historical prices to divine future prices. This technical analysis focuses instead on the current Option Open Interest. In other words my crayons taste different.  Whenever the stock price blue touches the delta neutral line green and crosses back up it tends to go another 58.  I developed a tool which uses the entire open interest to calculate three important numbers  Delta Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option delta is 0.  Gamma Neutral  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is 0.  Gamma Maximum  The price of the stock where the sum of all option gamma is the maximum.  The theory behind it is simple enough institutions tend to be the largest holders of short options contracts and are therefore obligated to hedge against those options contracts while collecting juicy premium riskfree.  By calculating similar numbers to what these institutions are dependent on I'm hoping to ride their coattails and earn tendies from their rounding errors.  Positions   BX  June 130C at $2.16  Will buy when market opens. Targeting to pay less than $2.60share for the contracts.,positive

Real estate market and the broader economy,I know there will be lots of just short the housing market bro responses but I am more interested in the opinions of the OG WSB autists if you guys are still around. Full disclosure I'm not involved in this market.   Papa powell lowered fed rates to almost 0 during the beer virus and printed paper so there were lots of easy money. This money first went into stonks and the market became too hot. Institutional investors had to find an alternative asset class and it seemed like they went into real estate.   As you have noticed the housing market went crazy over the last few years. However I also noticed this insane price hike is mostly for starter homes  aka the houses for entrylevel buyers getting their first home. These starters are singlefamily housesapartmentsduplexescondostownhouses you get the idea. In contrast my older wealthy friends' gt$1M mansion had seen maybe 300k increase while the starter houses my younger friends are looking to buy increased by x2 or x3.   Investors instead of home buyers purchased gt18 of all real estate sold in Q3 2021 alone Firms like BlackRock has bought 66 apartment complexes in my city  not units entire complexes. I also looked at the prospectus of two REITs Vanguard VNQ and BlackRock USRT and residential is the secondhighest holding in these funds. The top holding is something called Specialized REIT  I wonder if apartment complexes or residential RE holding companies count as such. In both funds' documents they identified increasing interest rates as a significant risk factor. The point is this is just two REITs. There are lots more of these institutional or even individual investors of various sizes buying up starter homes.   ampx200B  With all that said I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on where this is going and how it will end. The following is my speculation and thinkingoutloud so probably not everything makes sense   It seems to me like these institutions are cornering the market by controlling the supply and causing the price to increase and then slowly selling these starter houses to any sucker who would be willing to pay the ridiculous price ... so are they holding a bunch of empty houses waiting for appreciation or are they also renting them out How are the occupy rates   Switching gears  what about the packaging and reselling of these mortgages Anything going on there I know they never stopped selling CDOs after 0809. Like the film ending scene of 'the Big Short' pointed out they are now making 'boutique synthetic CDOs'  and call them 'bespoke tranche opportunity' and there's a lot of activity in product   As interest rates start to increase are institutions gonna fire sale and try to make their rival firms and new home buyers hold the bag I'm not sure of the exact cause or mechanism but if they needed to cooperate and hold it all together they wouldn't  just look at how they handled Bill Hwang's swaps. They all agreed to slowly unwind but right after the meeting when Credit Susse and UBS went to sleep Goldman and Morgan immediate offloaded and tanked those stonks and market in general. That's relatively small in comparison to the entire housing market.   Anyway I would love to hear your opinions thoughts and insights on this. Thanks for reading my rant.,negative

China binds Russian business. Entrepreneurs are switching to the yuan,As stated by money.pl   gt Sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine are pushing Russia into the orbit of Chinese influence.  Economic cooperation is tightening but Beijing plays a dominant role in this arrangement.  Dreams of a big ruble are falling aside.  Russian business is already switching to yuan billing and the Chinese are buying Russian oil and coal for their currency  gt Although Vladimir Putin dreamed of a petrublel and settlements with the West in the Russian currency the economic reality reveals this dream.  It is not the ruble but the yuan that has a much greater influence in the region and with each day of sanctions China's position will strengthen drawing Russia into an orbit of dependence and influence.  gt Russian banks have already recorded a sharp increase in the number of accounts in yuan writes Rzeczpospolita and explains that the transition to the yuan has become necessary for Russian business because of the sanctions.  gt This tendency is confirmed by a poll of the Kommersant newspaper quoted by Rzeczpospolita.  Since the beginning of the year the amount of funds in accounts in Chinese currency has increased approximately eightfold at Tinkoff Bank and fourfold at MTS Bank and Uralski Bank for Reconstruction and Development UBRD.  The same is happening at the St. Petersburg Bank where the number of these business accounts has almost 3.5fold and the number of contracts in Chinese currency has doubled.  gt Russian entrepreneurs are forced to trade in yuan.  The domestic currency is unstable and Western sanctions and Putin's decrees such as the one of March 5 prohibiting the repayment of liabilities to entities from the list of hostile countries in Western currencies make it difficult for entrepreneurs to do business with contractors abroad.  gt   China also has ambitions  at least in Asia  to dominate trade in its currency.  If you add to this the fact that the sanctions throw Moscow into the arms of Beijing's dependence the yuan will rather have a dominant role  confirmed in an interview with money.pl prof.  Dariusz Filar.  gt As Rzeczpospolita points out more Russian companies are betting on the yuan.  Among them are companies trading in spare parts textiles and food products.  The oil steel and mining industries are also starting to deal in Chinese currency.  According to the daily private Chinese companies are buying oil and coal from Russia for delivery in May and June.  gt Russia is falling more and more into the orbit of Chinese interests.  As we wrote in money.pl China is Russia's largest trading partner and although bilateral trade reached a new record of $ 147 billion last year these relations are very asymmetrical.  gt The strategic partnership between Russia and China brings more benefits to the Middle Kingdom than to Russia.  Russia is only the 15th export partner of the PRC.  In addition China has overtaken Russia in terms of trade with most Central Asian countries.  gt The situation is similar in the energy sector especially in the gas sector.  In 2014 after Russia's military intervention in Crimea when Russia received further economic sanctions from the European Union and was isolated in the West China after ten long years of negotiations suddenly decided to conclude a gas contract with it forcing the Kremlin to accept a low  delivery prices.

While I dont have positions yet I dont hate $FB or $PYPL here.    1. Plains All American Pipeline NASDAQPAA  PAA's strength lies in its welllocated midstream energy infrastructure in the lowestcost U.S. shale basin Permian Basin. In fact it has such substantial scale and strategic positioning in the Permian Basin that Morningstar speculates that  It's not much of a stretch to state that there is a high probability that in some fashion Plains touches every barrel of oil the Permian produces earning a fee if not multiple fees.  While weakness in volumes from the basin relative to supply of infrastructure has led to poor financial results for PAA in recent years demand is beginning to recover in the basin and we expect PAA to be a big beneficiary of this trend.   Wall Street analysts seems to agree with consensus estimates for distributable cash per unit expected to improve at a 7.9 CAGR over the next half decade despite growth capital expenditures set to decline to a mere $275 million in 2022 down from $950 million in 2020.  Management is allocating the extra free cash flow primarily towards paying down debt in an effort to further strengthen its investment grade standing and set the business up to better weather any future downcycles like it experienced in 2020.  Additionally PAA has been allocating free cash flow towards equity unit repurchases  accelerating its buyback pace in Q4  and is also growing its distribution at a brisk pace just hiked its quarterly distribution by 20.8 in an effort to restore it to its precut level.   With an expected 2022 free cash flow level of $1.3 billion PAA currently offers a mouthwatering 16.5 free cash flow yield that covers its recently increased distribution by more than two times.   This  when combined with expectations of strong perunit distributable cash flow growth over the next half decade  will enable PAA to deleverage grow its distribution and buy back units at a very solid clip and should lead to outsized total returns for unitholders. ,neutral

Many of you may know it as a boring tractor company. But step aside Ryan Cohen a new big daddy CEO is in town.  Scott Wine took over as CEO in January of last year and has already placed an Insider Buy for over 3 million worth of stock. He has split up CNHI so that they focus more purely on agriculture now making them a more agile company.  The most exciting part for me is that they just acquired Raven Industries for a bit over $2 billion. This makes them a contender in the high growth high profit margin industry that is autonomous driving tractors and other high tech ag equipment. They are becoming Deere but without the lawsuits or overpriced stock. To double down on this investment they announced 18 days ago that they are going to be building an advanced engineering center in Nevada USA in order to further propel their high tech farming advancements as well as attract talent to come work for them.  Scott Wine is the former CEO of Polaris and he absolutely transformed that company and exploded the stock. Just look I got my crayons out for you guys. The red circle is when Scott Wine took over in 2008. He took Polaris and made it into a global company imagine what he can do to CNHI.  ampx200B  formatpjpgampautowebpampsb0735c5eacc8fc522dd994dec12d9c2b28ffacdf  To be honest I am getting tired of doing DD If you can even call this that so I'll make this even briefer than I had planned and just spit some other factors that I am bullish about real quick. Ill also tag on some pictures.  CNHI is cheap compared to peers 11.74 pe such as Deere 23.19 and CAT 18.35 and even shitty Kubota 13.7 is more expensive  CNHI beats all recent earnings calls like crazy  Q1 2021 beat EPS by 128  Q2 2021  beat EPS by 57.46  Q3 2021  beat eps by 70.62  Q4 2021  beat eps by 19.48   Revenue were also all positives but I'm too lazy to type those all out look it up yourself.  Coincidently I saw a big ass Case tractor on the way home today and boy did it look sexy. I think this is a sign to buy.  Also this nice little picture shows you how it just bounced off the support line and is about to go up to the MOON  ampx200B  formatpjpgampautowebpampsfaa91378f7ca62f54150ad56c9cd3b9b537625b9  Also go to raven industries site  Raven Industries  Raven Industries  you will be impressed. CNHI is doing just as much cool stuff as Deere but it's not priced in yet. We are on the verge of an agriculture revolution and CNHI is poised to take the main stage.  Positions I lost most of my fun money gambling on HMHC sad face so I have to play it safer on this one since I cant afford to lose my savings. If you guys give me more DD and conformation bias then screw it Ill get more options. Currently I hold 110 shares 1 520 $15 call 1 617 $15 call.  If I had money to blow I'd buy the shit out of May or June $17.5 calls. Earnings will be May 3 and I expect it to move fast after another earning beats.  This is not financial advice I am probably more smoothed brained than most of you. This is a company that's in the same industry that I work in and I have a good feeling about it.,positive

Uranium neuron firing edition,U.UN  for the smooth brains now fuck off before your singular neuron start firing.  I'm at work forced to lay off the sugar so let's try to write something for the one guy whose IQ looped around 0. The guy who is rich as fuck but still get no bitches because he invests like a boomer.  Disclaimer a lot of the information here are second hand from people who are popular but some of the information aren't easily verifiable.  The base thesis  We have a demandsupply deficit. 200m pounds of annual demand 135m pounds of annual primary supply from the ground for a 65m pound annual deficit. These numbers are from UxC which is a major nuclear fuel consulting business. You can definitely model the numbers based on the number of operational reactors and respective output of each operating mine.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampsbfa572665dbbce1149ea9ecedc60bebb075241da  There is an unknown amount of secondary supply out there due to Japan's sudden halt of nuclear energy post Fukushima and the sale of the previously stockpiled nuclear fuels. There are also existing inventories as well as the concept of reverse carry trades. The important thing is that secondary supplies are limited they are good for one use and that's it.  When you use more than you receive you will face a shortage. A simple matter of when not if.  On the other side you have the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust SPUT. A simple investing concept where you give them money and they buy uranium U3O8 and store it. From 19 July 2021 they have purchased 36m pounds of uranium. This figure is not included in the 200m pound demand.  The NAV of the trust is a measly 3.5B which really isn't much in the investing world.  Prices have to go higher  Higher prices means more production it's that simple.   formatpngampautowebpampscf545e8081521d68b14c72f0b1c7a991a37678c4  The important thing to look at is the production cost indicator PCI. Current spot prices are $63.50lb vs the $52.00lb PCI.  I started investing in uranium last September. Back then the spot price was $40lb. Indeed the risk has increased but I'm not too worried as inflation is here to stay and miners will like demand higher prices to account for the inflation risk in the next 35 years as they built their mines.  Mines will run out  Once uranium gets mined out of the ground it's no longer in the ground.  formatpngampautowebpamps17c0bf99f61763641dda4c2ca68f2270a60669cf  Prices have to get high to incentivize existing mines to restart and even higher to incentivize exploration.  Similarly you can model these as a lot of the publicly traded companies will report the expected remaining life time of their mines.  Increasing demand  A lot of countries are building new reactors. Here are some of the big ones.  EU was having some luck with France leading the nuclear push in the EU taxonomy but things seemed to have quieten down.  Japan the real OG are planning to turn nuclear plants back on due to rising energy prices and also RUSSIAN ENERGY GO FUCK YOURSELF.    China has plans to build another 150 nuclear power plants by 2035. Previously I wrote a DD about the political genius of pivoting to nuclear energy as there is ample supply that are China friendly.   Kazakhstan produces about 40 of the world's supply of the base form of U3O8.  Russia is 13 of the world's capacity of converting U3O8 to UF6.  Russia is 40 of the world's enrichment capacity.    China is heavily pushing for electrifying of vehicles and a massive nuclear build out because they understand that reliance on oil means getting held by the balls by the US controlled middle east and that they can be easily blockaded. Going nuclear means energy security and we all know China will get something done when they want it to get done.    Russian Sanctions  Russia fucked Ukraine so now America and Europe decides to sanction Russian nuclear. Remember how Russia is 40 of the world's enrichment capacity  Turns out the enrichment process determines how effectively you can use the based U3O8. More enrichment means less U3O8 used underfeeding and vice versa overfeeding.    You can already see the effect of the ban through the nuclear supply chain.    formatpngampautowebpamps7b2c62a5e34dcc056bb284f926e9531c66aaa542  Sprott Inc  Sprott Inc is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing.  Two important products are the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust SPUT and the recently acquired North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF.  SPUT NAV has grown from 600M to 3.5B since 19 July 2021 till now.  Below is North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF's NAV prior to acquisition by Sprott.      Dated 7 April 2022formatpngampautowebpampsb6af78eeb04577b8d4f5baf065d81d88169a3ac9  Important thing is that Sprott is a heavyweight and knows how to raise money for their products.  With both the physical trust and the ETF under their control it's time for them to really ramp up capital acquisition.  Within a week of URNM's acquisition Sprott filed the application for SPUT to be listed on the NYSE.    How to play this  The common narrative is that miners are a leveraged play on uranium spot prices.  Assuming miner has an operating cost of $30lb a movement of spot prices from $40 to $60 would mean...  50 increase in spot prices and 200 increase in miner earnings.  It's a correct line of thought but the issue comes in that a lot of these miners are 35 years from production. During this time they will face inflation risk and ballooning capex costs. If they require further financing they face taking on debt at less attractive rates or share issuance which will result in dilution.  Next the miners price in what they expect prices to hold at. Just because spot price hits $200lb for 2 seconds and you managed to get one off in that time doesn't mean that miners will price in $200lb. The price has to hold for a significant time OR long term contracts have to be signed at those prices.  Lastly a liquidity crunch from QT and a prolonged bear market might result in suppressed stock prices but reactors will continue running and there will still be demand for the uranium metal propping prices up.  The two major producing companies Cameco and Kazatomprom both have their own issues.  Cameco runs the risk of a cash flow crunch if spot prices spike before they are able to ramp up production.   httpsimgur.comauuqzayA formatpngampautowebpamps98683825a6da1ca7eb220251710404959d03db76  Kazatomprom is in Kazakhstan and they had a riot in January due to rising oil prices and income inequality. Guess what food prices are rising and that typically comes with FREE SOCIAL INSTABILITY.   TLDR  The uranium thesis is the only other thing that gets me hard but many miners are going to be negative cashflow for the next 35 years facing potential dilution expensive debt and even bankruptcy.  Hence the risk to reward seems better on physical uranium.  Maybe it's because I laid off sugar for the past two days to type this out but the phrase risk management just popped up next to OH SHIT TO THE MOON in my dictionary.  Positions  Current positions 1000 U.UN shares 30K in Uranium ETF calls. 45k in Denison Mines.  Future Positions Rotating out of my Uranium ETF calls Denise Mines shares into a total 75 allocation in U.UN and 25 DCA in SOXS leaps.    ,negative

Desktop Metal  The Next Industrial Revolution Continued Apr. 22,Following on from my last DDutm_mediumios_appamputm_nameiossmf shared here on NYSEDM I thought Id share an update as to why I believe this has high potential for a significant shortterm move as well as exponential longterm returns.   Despite the heavy decline in share price postmerger due to dilution and marketwide downward pressure on SPACssmall capsspeculative stocks Desktop Metal remains a highly appealing company  particularly at current valuations.   WHAT DO THEY DO AGAIN  To reiterate my last post Desktop Metal operate in additive manufacturing i.e. 3D printing in almost every area you can imagine and the companys technology is protected by over 300 patents with further pending. The company itself originated from the 3D printing of metal products and their machines are designed to be faster smaller cheaper safer and without needing a trained operator.  However the company has also made and continues to make highprofile acquisitions to further diversify and expand their consumer base. In doing so they have also eliminated essentially all of their competition and gained significant IP and propriety technology security. The company is arguably the industry leader in applications as diverse as fluid power systems metallurgy ceramics and polymers all the way to wood products and biofabrication under its Forust and Desktop Health brands respectively.   The sheer technical ability they now possess is simply mind blowing and scope of this technology is literally infinite. PrototypingRampD becomes quick and cheap supply chain issues can be significantly reduced if not eliminated and the means of manufacturing needs no dependence on location for the exploitation of labor restrictions and costs nor the existence of borders as designs are digital. In addition to this the company manages and operates its own supply chain in over 65 countries.    WHAT HAS CHANGED  Since my last post the company has progressed with strength towards its growth targets and profitability. Desktop Metal and its subsidiaries boast an extensive list of bestinclass customers without disproportionate reliance on any single revenue stream.   Desktop Health launched the Einstein printer along with Flexcera resins perhaps the most accurate dental 3D printer to date and boasting FDA clearance for permanent use. Furthermore this transforms the process of creating dentures and other cosmetics to mere minutes and with perfect accuracy.  The company also welcomed the XSeries line of systems gained by the acquisition of their main competition ExOne in 2021. This system was also adopted immediately by the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation for use in advanced nuclear energy solutions.  Kimura Foundry Group puchased a 10th system stating that In the first five years after investing in its first ExOne sand binder jetting machines in 2013 Kimuras revenue increased more than 500 percent as a result of the speed and design freedom the new system provided to end customers  demonstrating the impact and desirability that Desktop Metals systems will have on manufacturers and designers along with cementing their repeat business from recurring revenue streams such as maintenance materials and repeat sales.  The company also launched its longawaited revolutionary P50 system after tripling its production capacity with Stanley Black amp Decker as the systems first notable customer of more than eighty in line. Shapeways also committed to more Desktop Metal systems in turn boosting the value of Desktop Metals stake in Shapeways.  CEO Rick Fulop also recently purchased over half a million dollars of DM stock. Fulop is noted as being distinctly protective of the companys future explaining the aggression of the acquisitions made using SPAC and dilution funds. Further to this Fulop has repeatedly stated there is zero chance of a hostile takeover. As such the company recently filed an ASR stating The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved Class A common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest tender offer merger or otherwise.    FINANCIALS  In the most recent earnings report the company outlined a 123 growth in revenue in the last quarter and up 62 excluding revenue captured by the acquisition of ExOne. They also demonstrated expanding margins for the sixth consecutive quarter. Furthermore total revenue was up 583 from the previous year. The company is guiding for $260M revenue for the current year up 131 from the last annual report. As of December 31st the company has $272.7M in cash and equivalents a large enough runway to reach profitability within five years.    STOCK  The companys stock has spent so far spent 2022 consolidating and is currently looking to settle into its $4.405.20 range after it broke out in midMarch placing it at a $1.387B market cap as of the latest close. This also places it precisely at a key area of demand and support and as such I expect a bounce to retest the resistance at $5.20.   The stock has been met with significant resistance at $5.20 but a close above this can signal a further breakout to fill the gap between $7.19 and $8.01  the average analyst price estimate and a 50 near term move. Such a move would bring the higher range of analyst targets into range breaking into the low teens.   Assuming that the company continues to execute on their planned trajectory and captures even just their small target percentage of the additive manufacturing market the stock is easily worth well into the hundreds within the next five years. Just a 5 market capture places fair value at $130share and I firmly believe that given the barrier to entry that DM have created via acquisitions IP expertise and technology they could capture upwards of 33  working out at about $830 as a long term price target as a minimum. There is simply no area they cannot penetrate with the same aggression execution and profitability as Amazon and I would not be surprised to see this as the biggest growth story of the next decade.      So let me know what you think Im currently holding 5000 shares and accumulating until profitability and likely beyond. The market cap is finding a floor at the companys core value so any move lower is entirely unreasonable and unsustainable in my opinion.,negative

$SPY  Predictions for the week of 411,Last week I said that SPY was going to slope down with nothing crazy that happened except my 5 day forecast got inversed.  The days that I thought would be bearish were actually bullish.    I was thinking about this and noticed how there is hundreds of ways the week could play out  that would result in SPY going down.    I am still going to continue the 5 Day Outlook because it is something funny to do just take it with a grain of salt because it is seriously impossible to predict every single day before the futures market even opens... I write these Saturday morning.    ampx200B  1 Day Chartformatpngampautowebpamps27e05d57d4deb60529bae70e73e6937f820f3fa2  The main levels have been the same for about a month now  Support 432  Resistance 452  The RSI is showing the K approaching an oversold reading there will at least be a short term relief in the selling pressure overall  1 Day Chartformatpngampautowebpamps590c166936580732ddbcfe55540e897b0827817c  I would classify the bollinger band with as a somewhat mean reverting indicator to get a sense of the overall volatility.  Since the bollinger bands have a relative wide span we can assume that we will likely be entering a phase of lower volatility.    ampx200B  CPI Data Release Dateformatpngampautowebpamps5317e8515c102614e5d3e4562d01e737d38e4a72  Everyone is going to be watching the CPI data when it is released on Tuesday.

There is nothing to be done now I am just waiting.  I still have a lot of positions open when this crash starts I will start to liquidate everything... believe me it will be very noticeable when it starts.   ampx200B  Federal Reserve FOMC statementformatpngampautowebpamps12b1e18659efc463475d55f038f17d0baf6db894  Bullard is concerned for the economy and wants at least a 50 to 75bp rate hike.  I actually found this kind of interesting because he is one of the least corrupt people in office.  He has a net worth around 5 million which is surprisingly low for having inside information.  He also has never worked with big banks and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.  He definitely knows what is going on and what needs to be done to save the economy.  The federal reserve will eventually have to become more aggressive in rate hikes.  ampx200B  Crude Oil CFDsformatpngampautowebpampsd943fa66e23d9a16dc6745f34c4e1246e88f48dd  Predictions  Tuesday is going to be an extremely important day.  I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10.  Oil rose 35 in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5 which is going to shock the markets.    Another factor is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.    The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.  I hate to be that person but over the last year with unemployment decreasing spending increasing and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80 without interfering.  At most there will be a 50 bear market similar to 2008.  The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell then it should recover in the following days.

Big BEAR warning U.S. stocks could tumble at any time,It's almost a multiple issue Burry wrote on Twitter 44.48 2.53 5.38. He also included a chart that tracks pricetoearnings ratios for the SampP 500's equallyweighted index. The chart shows that the ratio was below 1.0 for much of the 1990s and 2000s but has almost doubled in the past decade and is now above 1.9.  Presumably Burry would like to point out that the index is trading at almost twice the revenue of its constituents  suggesting that the valuation multiples of America's largest public companies have reached unsustainable heights.  Goldman Sachs 319.78 0.98 0.31 strategist MacNeil Curry pointed out last week that it's not just the 10year note that's worth noting. Yields on 5year and 2year notes are also fast approaching or testing significant longterm trendlines a breach of which would signal the end of the downtrend since the 1982 yield highs.  Burry is best known for his Big bet on the U.S. housing bubble in the mid2000s popularized in the book and movie 'The Big Short.' He also invested in GameStop before its stock price soared in January 2021 paving the way for the Meme stock boom. Last year he also made highprofile bets on Musk's Tesla 986.95 11.02 1.13 and On Ms. Wood's flagship product the Ark Innovation ETF.  Burry has repeatedly warned over the past 18 months about overvalued assets and predicted a historic selloff. Last June he warned that the market was in the midst of the biggest speculative bubble in history.  But he always emptied his Twitter feed shortly after warning of a stock market crash. This was his first tweet since March.  Bond bulls face 'last Line of defense'  Meanwhile bond bulls are facing their own crisis of faith with some media suggesting that the bulls' last line of defense has now arrived. Carter Worth of CNBC said  A logarithmic move in the 10year US Treasury yield shows that it is testing the most important trend line ever seen in any market.  While 10year Treasury yields rose above 2.80 per cent on Tuesday morning before march's postCPI plunge they need to close above 2.83 per cent to mark a break in trend.,positive
I Working You Working WeWorking,  I Working You Working WeWorking  Wall Street Oasis   I don't have a position right now nor have I ever had one but it is safe to conclude that WeWork is a solid buy right now. This is a birds' eye view of the company but I doubt the broader thesis here changes.  1. Share price is 51 down since going public in Oct'20 it's currently at $4.84 and since the lowest it can go is obviously 0 downside is reasonably protected as you're buying it at a cheap discount  good value...maybe they have to raise equity again in the very foreseeable future given historical levels of cash burn but the following note was penned taking atleast a 2436 month time view     2. I spent some time at a few different WeWorks the summer of 2018 in Chicago and felt back then that there was a lot they could get away with. For instance serving beer in the office was an unnecessary expense to incur and so were arranging events with the goal of bringing the community together not only in my experience were these events thinly attended but also noise pollution for those who were actually trying to get stuff done. Obviously these are anecdotes that I am relaying here but the broader point here is that in a way the PR crises that WeWork faced has been good for the company and I think they will emerge with a better balance sheet and more streamlined operating model more below  3. WeWork's focus on location  expense rationalization as well as willingness to extract more from landlords net capex for improvements is I think reflected in its improving operating cash flow. If WeWork needs to amendcancel the lease they should have reasonable negotiating leverage with the landlord to not get fucked over because given this ecommerce boom and consequently the need for logistics  warehouse operations to be closer to the endcustomer in order to minimize delivery and waiting times an astute landlord should have options.WeWork's locations based on my limited experience in Chicago 2018 and Toronto 2022 tend to be located in decently quality areas with good enough foot traffic and nearby amenities. Where it does own properties and wants to sell to rationalize there should not be a shortage of buyers.   4. I personally don't like working in shared spaces but I do think that most people do enjoy them and this is a model that is here to stay. Since WeWork has a firstmover advantage is protected by VERY high barriers to entry and its name is synonymous with office share this will bode well for the company. Plus WeWork should be a good alternative for companies looking to rationalize their real estate foot print post this pandemic  epidemic  5. Biggest upsides to the model though are the expected rampups in the physical occupancy rates and the growing  of Enterprise Members who are less pricesensitive and locked in for a longer tenor. Physical occupancy currently around the 5060 and back in 2018 was around 80. Focus on Enterprise Members is also showing  of members who are enterprise companies with gt 500 employees was 38 and 42 in 2018 and 2019 respectively. It currently is 47 and though less than where it was in Dec 2020 52 pandemic played a role here...  6. Lastly and this is not something that I say lightly that the company already screwed up once in 2019 which led to all kinds of PR crises for its biggest shareholder Softbank and others. They should not screw this again. A lot on the line and so I expect nuts and bolts to tighten as well as bettersound corporate governance to prevail going fwd  At a share price of $4.84 the market is just not factoring these things i.e. not giving them enough credit for their growth prospects. I am not a WeWork scout here and so not trying to act like a telemarketer here but if you're not constraint by investment time horizon this is definitely a buy for the next 23 years if not more.,positive

41122 SPY AMD QQQ F Apple VIX Daily TA,    The day before CPI the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my 2 red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days.   The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesnt have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema above for bearish and below for bullish.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps89e988c2486c9a35886e64c0572dda7db4c7f52f  We actually established yet another downward channel today that I dont suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps460f3ed4daf222a62703d594bc51c6a74e98085e  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps4347b8f4c091377d1ce4fba1560a3adac832fe92  We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse.   But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I dont really forsee unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10 that we do it but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampsb1186f1a49dfdb4c8482bfe6b8db71a3e6c0a15d  The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampscb628bb79afa7a42f5d89e96ee5161666ca6c136  The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20 50 and 100 ema on the daily 445.21 446.55 and 446.63 but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside.   Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 unlimited upside BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I dont suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps7116303960c6b14d65486a7a6055fe9d2f6ebe3b  Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema 443.96 445.9. The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 weekly 50.   Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday monthly option expiration.   Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p.   Thursday monthly has 15k 445c 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p 66k 435p 113k 430p.  That is a massive amount of OI to the downside thats expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too.   With the last CPI being 7.5 expected at 7.9 but the consensus at 8.4 its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war gas prices more covid etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampsd6cb5a86ef7f0a6606d8305928378625e0d55be0  Apple had a heck of a red day today too mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today. I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not however expect it to happen today. However I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning.   Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here.   Channel support tomorrow is 157 unlimited downside and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However if Apple loses 165.54 daily 100ema we can expect further downside this week.   I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may reenter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps815d5abea3eb8fcfa988a512045e85dccccf6818  The blood for AMD just continues but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive 5.2 hit which I believe it was down around 6 at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 7274. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right.   I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema tomorrow most likely to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps656bccd6c7693ffbff25068cf8b80b2484feb77c  Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5 however after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.  Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I dont suspect the RSI to be an issue.   Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps7e647a1487ff5cbb7889db0f47334e17a6429f2b  QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how.   Channel support is 322 unlimited downside and resistance is 342 for tomorrow.   I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20 50 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps50292337467bbf1fd1b3d55a377e4955d987401b  The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11 from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels but mind you that was on the downside not the upside.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps718eb38d4ea8f47c4467f046cff1e33dd4fed944  When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI.   Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising 30 year fixed mortgages rising again the inverted treasury yields inflation covid war gas etc. etc. etc. recession etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two.   While some dont think its a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of... took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling thats the preample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow.   10 challenge  Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19 a spy put for 20 and a call for 20. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70 at open that spiked to 30 around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at 30. I also played a call and put for 25 then 10 during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10 puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal however factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.,positive
Inflation Announcement  My Prediction,Back a couple months ago I made a post about how inflation is a lot higher than reporting and that inflation reporting is time delayed.  Well today is that day those predictions start to come true.  And it's only the start unless the Fed goes hard and fast on taming it which will have other repercussions.  Inflation will exceed expectations possibly coming to 10 annually.    Then the 10 yr treasury yield will punch through the resistance level of 2.8...  And then we will be in a new territory that we haven't been in for 30 years.    The Fed action will determine continued inflation stagflation or deflation.     Enjoy.,negative

The Company paid $24901 or $10.15 per share to repurchase these shares. These shares were repurchased using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger. On February 23 2022 the Tenor Investors exercised their right to sell to the Company approximately 2.5 million shares which constituted all shares held by the Tenor Investors. As of the end of the first quarter of 2022 the Company repurchased all of these shares using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger.  The option chain is loaded. Current OI  15c alone has 130 of the entire float ITM 12.5c are barely 35 hedged lt10 move in commons would mean almost half the float would need to be hedged when 12.5c go itm.

Zoom Video Sucks, Zoom Video is Pointless to Have Around  Wall Street Oasis   I have no position in Zoom nor have I ever held any but I NO IDEA why a company like ZOOM Video is first of all around and if you can make an argument for its existence WHY is it trading at such high valuation multiples relative to companies Microsoft Google Cisco Google that have more compelling growth profiles with the financial wherewithal to pursue those paths and  or either offer a competitive service.  Better Substitutes  Zoom's revenue growth has definitely stalled recently and while the market has revised price for it it hasn't adequately done so IMO. There might be a hybrid model going forward but folks will eventually have return to the office what do you think the large corporates will do with the real estate on their portfolio Working remotely might work for some businesses but in most cases particularly with those that have large budgets creativity and productivity will be negatively impacted and these companies already have better alternatives. Think about banks and law firms which are already using MS Office applications for their staff and would rather stick with MS Team. These are extremely sticky relationships that Zoom will never be able to displace and if Zoom tries to build its product offering it will obviously come at a cost to their alreadymediocresubpar cash flow profile  Financial Profile   The company supposedly offers different products but it doesn't really provide any segmentation on topline apart from geography. If their core product offering was growing they would been making a point of highlighting that  Company segments customers into two parts 1 Businesses gt 10 employees and 2 Businesses generating gt100K in revenue.     36 of Zoom's Revenue came from businesses lt 10 employees. These by definition  of people employed are very small businesses don't have significant IT budget and MORE importantly are most likely very price sensitive. If shit hits the fan this 36 will evaporate quickly      Cost of acquiring these customers generating gt 100K in revenue has been increasing over the years while the LTV  CAC ratio a key metric that you look at for tech companies has just never been compelling enough to warrant such a valuation. For acquisition costs I am factoring in 25 of COGS and allocating 100 of RampD Sales amp Marketing General amp Admin  while the 25 is an assumption for the rest of the cateogries the company states that the primary cost in the other buckets is personnel costs. You can agreedisagree with the exact s here but the thesis doesn't change i.e. LTVCAC is poor and has been falling over the years. For LTV it's the gross margin on these largest accounts that presumably the company has been challenging its sales and marketing efforts towards. An IDEAL LTV to CAC ratio should be 31 while for this company it's been 0.2 and more recently has trended to 0.1. Sounds great to me. This becomes even more abysmal to view when you understand that bulk of company's stock compensation over the years has gone to sales and marketing folks. Either they are hiring total incompetent staff so their hiring policies are not great or the product itself is so poor and there is no need for it that the sales folks can't really do much. I am willing to bet that it is a combination of both reasons     Lastly the productivity ratio of the company which I define as Revenue  Employee Average Employee Salary isn't great either. Initially it was 1.19x when they went public and though it's gone up to 1.9ish more recently it begs the question if the company's products were THAT HOT why aren't they bringing in more topline especially keeping in view the acquisitions that they have made over the last couple of years to the tune of more than $300 million. Again same argument as before either incompetent staff whacky hiring policies no need for the service and  or just poor capital allocation      I also believe that the company misleads investors and is trying to paint a more rosy picture of its Free Cash flow by not including adjustments that it should make otherwise. Why are marketable securities which are short term investments being classified in the cash flow from investing activities AND NOT operating cash flow sounds more like a working capital item to me. PLUS they re not really factoring in acquisitions only stuff relating to PPE. If you start incorporating all these adjustments you notice that their cash flow profile is just plain terrible  they've gone from a 4 margin Cash Flow  Revenue to an outstandingly negative 40 in 2022    Legal Proceedings  In recent memory I also really can't think of any such TECH DARLING that got ensnared in either litigation or had security breaches happen on its platform since going public this soon or in a relatively short amount of existence. Think about it if the technology and all was REALLY that good would such events happen These black swan events in my view point to the fact that there is nothing propretiary about what this company is doing. I haven't even looked to explore patents or lack of because the offering is so basic it is essentially Skype that it would be a futile attempt to investigate   Valuation  This just amazes me that on EV  Revenue basis applicable for high growth companies or companies that haven't fully ramped up yet Price to Book Value Price to Cash Flow Basis and Price to Earnings basis the company just trades at a high premium keeping all the above in mind relative to the average of the following analogues Cisco Microsoft Google Amazon Sales Force and has INFACT traded at higher levels since its publicmarkets debut compared to the levels during either the post IPO years for the analogues or since these analogues have come to the market i.e. went public. I know that Amazon doesn't really have a video conferencing platform unlike others but the reason behind selecting it was because it came to the market with something unique that did not exist before yet didn't get the same valuation. Same goes for Google Google Meet Salesforce Slack and Microsoft TeamsSkype. Now these companies excluding Amazon but including Cisco which offers Webex are still not being priced that highly as Zoom is for which the only reason I can think is maybe the regulators break the tech giants up but that is too much time consuming and too much hassle for regulators so I doubt it plus it's not as if these companies will give up their land that easily so which again begs the question and makes me sound like a broken record that why is Zoom being looked at so favorable when it neither has ANY competitive moat nor does it really have a strong financial profile or a track record of executing its goals. Yes it's board of directors and all may be impressive but these are not the folks on the ground running the company.,negative

Bearish on Musk buying TWTR Here's what you can do.,TLDR   Bearish on Musk Buying Twitter Buy TWTR Sep 42 Puts for $4.40share or less  Bullish on Musk Buying Twitter Sell TWTR Puts for more than Strike Price  $54.20  ampx200B  In case you haven't already heard Elon Musk wants to buy twitter. SEC Filing  The offer was stated to be best and final. Whether or not that's actually true is yet to be seen.      Here are the obvious outcomes along with the probability based on yesterday's option open interest   Twitter accepts the offer.      Shareholders are paid $54.20share.      Market Estimated Probability 65  Twitter rejects the offer Musk stays a shareholder.      Price has a small dip but is otherwise flat.     Market Estimated Probability 15  Twitter rejects the offer Musk dumps his shares.     Price falls back to preMusk levels.     Market Estimated Probability 20   Market is currently pricing in a 20 chance of scenario 3 happening. I think that probability is higher especially considering how volatile Musk can be.   I recognize there may be new option buying to reflect the new probabilities. I can check that after 5pm NY time and adjust my position on Monday.   Implied volatility for the April through August strikes are very elevated which reduce potential riskreward on the play.  So I'm looking to buy TWTR Sep 42 Puts for $4.40share or less as I think there's a better than 20 chance that Twitter rejects Musk's offer and Musk sells his shares.  For those who want to inverse me you can sell Puts for any strike above $54.20 so that you can collect the premium and the proceeds from the acquisition price of $54.20,positive

And hey don't forget the most important thing i have been trying to superimpose in everyone's mind by repeating it that in Q4 202223 we will have a recession.

Hopefully by June bond carnage will stop.  ampx200B  We talked about this theory technically in Credit Risk Americaformatpngampautowebpamps0462236e78b675bcada45032d33aceb56c96ff86  ampx200B  Personally i haven't told anyone to short bonds cause when some of you asked me I told you it's too late. But do keep an eye on CDS and time it with recession. You could make 201 this time around.  ampx200B  CDS in USA 5yr.

DXY has also gone to $100 just as we predicted as it's a basic Wyckoff accumulation pattern of 20yrs. The only thing that remains is when the FED will inject QE and debase their currency again. I have told this too to some of you in the comments section that i see it happening after the recession not before.  ampx200B  DXY is at $101 now. So you can see how far we have come from.formatpngampautowebpamps0f5b8383acba5e9bf2dcc49046314a59d692cb8f  ampx200B  3. Cash is Haven  Yah i know most people wont agree with this thought. But my readers know how well it's going to hold up to cash.  ampx200B  Why is cash importantformatpngampautowebpamps516bd0e240c9a400bc127209a30b12917053e382  ampx200B  Do you know why I said so  Because I was waiting for an option other than  TINA  Its bonds. That's why I told you all to HODL cash. Now some might argue well how are we going to fight inflation. Well you can't this year but surely in 10yr you can. You just have to look at Real Bond yields chart. They are positive. Meaning investors are keeping an eye on that. And i can sure as hell tell you Bank of America is buying coz they have set their targets 2.35 at 10yr note.  So buy bonds and you get a halfyearly payment on it. And when that payment arrives in lets say Q4 or the 2023 recession. Buy your favorite moneymaking stocks at a cheaper price or Gold coz Gold too falls in Recession. It's that simple strategy. And also pray that bonds don't get obliterated in this coming recession like a 4sigma bubble collapse. I'm betting things will take turns. First bonds then the housing market later on putting pressure on stocks and the word which i cannot speak here.  But the key would be to buy which bonds and at what time  So i would recommend a 2yr  5yr for flipping and 10yr bond as an investment. Time would be May June period. So time it with your T.A. on bonds using Daily and weekly TF. I have given you the month.   ampx200B  Billionaires Buy Zone for TLT  16 May  16 June 2022formatpngampautowebpamps580550c7334322f5df589ea8b9784fa2139579bc  So I think I have given you a rough idea of what we have predicted so far. But as time progresses things could turn but so far it's all going according to our plan.  _________________________________________  ampx200B  It's been the longest recap in the history of the WSB i suppose. But now lets move on from this and take a look at what has happened these past weeks and how are we gonna trade in MayJune intelligently so that we don't get lost in the volatility jungle.  Key events that have happened and some that are coming up   ampx200B  1. Earnings Season   a Bank Earnings   ampx200B  Banksformatpjpgampautowebpamps0c0c03156449b34a2748e2bf00eb3e416059d1ee  ampx200B  JP Morgan  ____________  So JP Morgan kicked off with earnings last week. I must say something seems fishy there with Nickel Trading and their losses in Russia. Just like any other conspiracy theorist i cannot help but wonder that the books are being cooked there. Regardless though i love Jamie Dimon and if you are reading this sir you did a great job this decade. I wish you Happy Retirement early on. Wall Street will miss you when you leave office this year.  Highlights of earnings   gt People have more cash in q1 than q4. I bet some of the people took profits  gt There was a rise in debt by people. And combined credit  plus debt rose 21 compared to last year.  gt Earnings were bad for JPM. Hence EPS low. They suffered some losses in Russia and also the transactional revenue has declined. But they offered share buybacks from May 1 which is bullish. Overall if you are investing in banks it's complicated. But hey some institutions think JPM is trading at a discount of $2030 so there's that.  ampx200B  Goldman amp Morgan stanley  _____________________________  The same was the story with these two giants. Making money. Their traders made a killing in q1. but trading revenue isn't that high compared to last yr. And consumers are still spending like no tomorrow.  ampx200B  Bank of America  __________________  gt Defaults are lower than 2019 levels..  gt Mortgage rate up  gt Q1 opened more credit cards. And they are spending more.  gt Relaxation by China later on in Q2 and Russia situation by Victory Day  They believe it. Not me   So overall i would say we kinda expected this from bank earnings. They didn't beat our expectations by huge numbers and they all took a hit from Russia. Going into Q4 we would see rates yields up and a steepening curve. So banks should do well theoretically. Well they aren't for now. But that could soon change once we get more clarity from the FED. Otherwise we are gonna get a financial crisis on top of a recession.  ampx200B  b Tech Earnings   ampx200B  Next week is so important guys. Stay sober.formatpjpgampautowebpampsaab16fbf1ffe2cb61d39211d069872d813486790  ampx200B  56 mega cap tech giant making up $8T dollar market cap are coming next week. They carry the entire SampP500 on their backs. Lets see how they perform next week. Finger crossed.  But lets talk about this hilarious Dotcomstyle chart from a company called Netflix. What a script it has written. I feel sorry for Bill Ackman that i really wanna invest in it. Kidding XD  ampx200B  Netflix  My Buy entries  White Lines formatpngampautowebpampsc1075ccfc933209bce42e8bb118336abd689c4ce  ampx200B  Lets analyze what happened with it  1. The Advertizing business is getting hit by Apple. It happened in January too with NFLX FB SNAP. And soon Google will follow Apple's path. 2. Inflation man. Its killing the future earnings of growth stocks combined with increased competition from HBO Max Disney and Apple TV which are seriously more good than netflix content. 3. Took hit from Russia Ukraine and Elon Woke tweets. Hence Lost subscribers. 4. Its strategy of pricing power by doubling amounts and flip flopping on password sharing didn't work out as they hoped.  remember those tweets from before   Overall its a consumer discretionary growth stocks and not worthy to be named together with FAANG. I'll go with MANGA from here now  MSFN  AAPL  NVIDIA  GOOGL  AMZN  Meta and Netflix need a break.  Note  Even though NFLX got steam rolled from every part you could think of. But it's soon going to have a pullback from Stranger Things 4 which no one is talking about. So trade well my friends but remember don't get attached. It will fall to $120130 later on is what i believe.  83 crash. Love that number  Could possibly go to $6080 in recession. Would be a good buy then for next 10yrs.  I also wanted to talk about Twitter.  ampx200B  Twitter Bullish Chart if Elon Buys the Companyformatpngampautowebpampsce3fb959b78b6ced3ab95b2fe52ff9294cae0e63  ampx200B  Just by looking at charts from back to December 2013 you can probably see that the company hasn't done anything innovating. Maybe that's what you get when you run a company on Blood money  The person who created the platform is out   So as we all know Elon wants to buy the company because he wants to bring free speech to one of the biggest networking platforms of our generations. He could have built his own social networking media company like Trump did. But he understands the power of the networking effect. Hence he pitched his offer of $54.20  i would look it as May 4 420 means  crazy times at FOMC  and freed up some cash.  So the board of directors can either take it or leave it. But the chart says to me that they don't want to give up a financial weapon and promote free speech. Hence they are taking the poison pill approach against Elon's hostile takeover.  So Elon comes up with an argument and says every board has a fiduciary duty towards its share holders. And it should take steps to benefit the company. So the board decided lets just calm the environment themselves and gave up a holiday to employees who were worried of getting fired by Elon Musk. That just speaks to me of the direction in which the company is headed.  Imo this board either has a magical plan to turn the ship around or they are just too dumb to recognize the potential of this company.  Only time will tell what's going to happen.  ampx200B  2. May 34  Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC   Powell Brainard Daly  President of San Fransico   Summers  Former FED Secretary of the Treasury 19992001  Bullard  President of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis   These 5 guys have eaten the head out of me. Why in the world do we have to keep watching them as they speak.  ampx200B  FED buy sell indicatorformatpngampautowebpamps6a25642d6f292965f23aeb4e5980df53f9f3f0db  ampx200B  Especially Powell guys. I am beginning to think that the FED has lost all credibility. They are being dishonest and rigging the market. Look at Sarah Eisen at FED. She basically asked Powell everything before the IMF presentation and took a short position. She put Powell on the spot by asking tough questions like Do you want the market to go lower and about Rate hikes.  To which Powell replied Ahhhhhhhhh for the first and the second one 50bps is on the table  Markets crashed immediately that day and the day later when reports emerged of 50bps being priced for May  June  July. Just wow.  We went from Inflation is transitory  25bps gradual hikes in March 16 FOMC to consecutive 50bps with faster tightening cycles. And also removing balance sheet accomodation.  Lets look now at FOMC to see if they actually can live up to their word and hike 50bps. If they did well its pretty much priced in and we don't have to care much about the first 100bps but if they went with 25bps. Markets should go up.  Also the FED fund future is now targeting 3.25 for EOY. Lets see how it all unravels. Personally i would watch Overnight repo and Spreads even though last time like in 2018 case wont happen. Because now the FED has a facility watching for unusual rates movements.  Also do look out for the data in USA GDP. 2 quarters of ve GDP is recession.  ampx200B  3. May 6  Jobs report  Like it or not the jobs market is overheated. A wage price spiral started to happen in January report but not so much now. Maybe this report of may could show us that again.  For now I dont think Job's numbers matter much now. More of the jobs added to the current est. only gives FED more initiative to hike rates as they like or talk like 75bps or even 100bps.  But here's an interesting chart that I would like to share that literally no one is talking about.  ampx200B  Recession  Gray U reverse Orange  Wage growth yoy Red  CPI yoy White  FED funds rateformatpngampautowebpamps56caf1fb7c653f47df7600a3495e78e1226ee2a9  ampx200B  I would like to point out two but maybe you guys can find three interesting things in the chart   1. If inflation gt or near the proximity of wage then the FED hands are forced to increase the FED funds rates and cause recession. 2. During the tightening cycle wages tend to decrease downwards later on. This would mean that companies would come under some kind of pressure during this phase of the cycle. 3. Is your H.W. XD  ampx200B  4. May 9  Victory Day  So why is this day so important. Well top professionals say like 1000 crazy but drunk people like me on Wallstreet think that the stock market hasn't seen quite huge a selloff as it should. Maybe the reason behind it is the fact Buy at the sound of cannon and sell at the noise of trumpets rally is going on and its creating an opposite effect to FED put theory  I am sure you must know about Greenspan Bernanke and now Powell put. I dont know how Janet Yellen missed the train. Comments down below XD  This theory is quite simple. You buy at peak fear and you sell at peak greed. Kinda like Bad news is good news and good news is bad news. I hope you all are getting my point.  You can also check historical returns i am sure that would back my theory.  Here's the last time when similar situation happened. And people i apologize beforehand if this chart brings back haunting memories from the past or you have situations related to it.  ampx200B  Afghanistan War  Invasion October 2001  Buy and sell later on bw 5690 days.formatpngampautowebpamps5a0ddd0cc1d788f61feea473a5d469d3258be6e1  ampx200B  ampx200B  This is my current projection. Lets see how this works out.formatpngampautowebpamps61322dc8ec0ff4eaffbbcfe9eb2d35b6de7a2546  ampx200B  5. May 11  CPI  Consumer Price Index   Well I am sure by now everybody has figured out what happens during the CPI and what data we look for. For those who dont know. Well allow me to explain   Nowadays we all know the CPI will come higher.  So 34 days before the CPI the market starts selling off. But when CPI exp. comes out lower then the market starts to go up.  But when CPI gets released there are always some few things that bother everybody and make a issue out of. So the market decides to sell regardless. Buy the rumor good CPI and sell the news CPI and then go up a few days later.  If the horrible CPI comes out then go much lower than we started that up rally.  ampx200B  Oil amp Gas prices moving upformatpjpgampautowebpamps9fffa9d6aca8a970d9b40243b6c5b328def6ee23  ampx200B  There are few metrics that are deciding whether it's a good or bad CPI report  a Core PCE inflation  Well this is the inflation that FED targets cause its from the demand side. Its the CPI inflation minus the food and energy. We need to see it decrease month over month so that we can see the inflexion point in the curve when supplydriven inflation comes down.  b The Headline Inflation  This is the headline number inflation which comes out to scare off the people. This number constitutes the food and energy part which recently has been called Putin Price Hike in America.  Note  The inflation you're seeing is not only from Putin but also from the excess money printing and helicopter money distributed after the pandemic. The value of the dollar has gone down significantly and it takes about 2yrs to see the full effect of monetary policy which you're seeing it now.  So the same case could be made for this tightening cycle if it actually went through which would let us see the bottom of all bottoms in late 20232024. But no doubt you can see some strong reaction rallies in the bear market too. I hope that makes sense.  ampx200B  Closing thoughts   Well now I wanted to talk about how Nasdaq SP500  Russell 2000 and Dow Jones might witness a price action which would take a route using my fundamental analysis with technical analysis.  But sorry guys i'm busy and have to go somewhere. You guys can check out the technical analysis down below and time it with your own fundamental analysis.  ampx200B  SampP500formatpngampautowebpamps7aafafba0f31f7a4e73d3c38204b1942c583aafe  Nasdaq 100formatpngampautowebpampsa8dbcb716f3d60adf7d84b8fc060af6266fdc0b1  But still i might give you a hint.  Case 1   As we all know April doesn't look so good so far. But im expecting a comeback rally in the last weeks of April provided if the tech earnings are good enough that it impresses the investors. Once we go up then sell in may gets activated because you cant get past the extreme risk off weeks till CPI at May 11. But hopefully month over month core pce comes down and then we kickstart the bear market up rally again till last few weeks of May.  ampx200B  or the other thing that could happen is  ampx200B  Case 2   The tech earnings doesn't impresses investors. We go down. More people start buying FED puts for FOMC and it piles up so much that we go down horribly before FOMC. Powell then comes out in the interview and calms everything down. And hopefully we go up again and get slightly pulled off by CPI but then CPI comes good and we kickstart the up rally again to last few weeks of May and sell again before FOMC.

"VIX in Uptrend for First Time since 2008 2000."," VIX in Uptrend.  2020 and 2018 flash crashes did not exhibit prolonged volatility runups. They were volatility spikes.

"Nutrien $NTR They help make your food now they help make you money","Hi everyone I have recently entered into a call position on Nutrien $NTR due to technicals and macro news. First a little bit of background Nutrien Ltd. provides crop inputs and services. It offers potash nitrogen phosphate and sulfate products and financial solutions. The company also distributes crop nutrients crop protection products seeds and merchandise products. Basically Nutrien provides a lot of fertilizer needed for industrial scale farming. They are a sizeable company with a market cap of nearly 60 billion and they also pay close to a 2 dividend. The dividend is not why im in this stock however. Im in it mainly for the technical set up.  Daily chartformatpngampautowebpamps744c2bb071e5a5e840028ade5909b741d68eaa1a  First of all Nutrien has seen a drop as of recent. This is most likely a result of the massive run up it has been having since feb. The stock has now bounced on the 50 ema and 38.2 retracement from the run up. This leaves the stock on good grounds to resume its rally.  Hourly chartformatpngampautowebpamps74310544ad8a304f994e5a6b5ddbb5792e09c391  Now looking at the hourly chart the stock is on the cusp of breaking through resistance almost did today but market dropped eod. It is also on the verge of filling a gap of nearly 2.5 which can happen in a days span. Combined with the fact that earnings are around the corner Nutrien is poised to pop. One final thing to mention is being a fertilizer company they stand to benefit from the fertilizer shortage as im sure their pricing has increased. There is also higher demand as crop prices have increased and farming season is underway. That being said I believe they will crush ER.  The June 17 option chain has $200mil or more of OI on the call side. There is 30k OI $15mil on the 105 strike alone. To me this means that a lot of big money is just parked for a rally.

Daily active users declined for the first time and the company forecast weakerthanexpected growth.  Firstquarter results should shed light on how macroeconomic trends like inflation and the war in Ukraine may be impacting ad spending on the platform. Growth is expected to come in at 7.8 slipping into the single digits for the first time in Facebooks 10year history as a public company.  In Snaps earnings  week CEO Evan Spiegel said the period proved more challenging than we had expected. Alphabet followed with disappointing numbers on Tuesday largely attributable to weak ad spend on YouTube  Analysts will also be watching to see how Facebook is navigating Apples new app transparency rules which Meta CFO Dave Wehner said last quarter would result in a $10 billion revenue hit this year  Wehner told analysts on the companys earnings call at the time that the figure was an estimate of the overall impact of the iOS changes on 2022 revenue.  We cant be precise on this. Its an estimate he acknowledged adding that the company believes the impact will be substantial.  With the stock down almost 50 this year Metas guidance will be of particular importance to investors looking for signs of optimism.

So quick example Apple opens at $150 and I play the 152.5 call and the 147.5 put lets just say they each cost $100 and Im in for $200 total one side runs up to $150 a con while the other only drops to $70 a con leaving a $20 gain.   Now lets say I repeat the strategy the next day with Apple in the exact same way and it worked out the same way leaving a $20 gain again so now Ive put a total of $400 during these 2 days to make these trades and my gain on one side following my example led to the contracts on the profitable side being worth $300 while the loosing side is left with a total value of $140 which leaves the $40 gain.

I do want to point out the increased activity around $150P$160P. That appears to be what is being priced in by institutional participants.  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps6de20bdc7e5c5f526934b9e88f5ff2fbee2d88ac  The vast majority of the open interest looks to be at the $150 strike while most of the hedging activity looks to be between $150 and $160  Most of the open interest is pricing in a drop. Surprisingly someone has been buying a ton of 0429 $120P. Maybe speculative apes  Over the last couple days in the run up to earnings IV has gone from 40 to 160 and will likely continue to 200 by market close.  formatpngampautowebpampsa83af45d80fd23c708b542ad2cfefb60670b30fc  ampx200B  FB is also quite far from its delta neutral Green line. Most recently delta neutral has been a point of resistance. That may continue to be true for foreseeable future. Notably the increased put buying has brought delta neutral down. Source   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps0d07b921737ec12eec7fc14f2749bb28741b7234  Current ATM options show the probable range after market close of $166  $190.50.  I'm anticipating a drop but still want to make money so I need to make sure the options contracts I buy are profitable at the $150 mark which currently represents a 16 decrease from yesterday's close. It's possible all this dropping is priced in from the previous quarter. It's also possible that Meta's headwinds have accelerated and further future statements will paint a more dire picture of the company.  Remember that the cost of IV crush will be massive. So you need to pick a strike price that you reasonably expect will expire ITM.  So with that being said these are the positions I intend to open before market close   0429 155P at $2.75 or less  0429 157.5P at $3.00 or less  0429 160P at $3.25 or less  0429 160P at $4.50share  Unclear to what point I can get fills at these prices but I'm going to try.  Edit Doesn't look like I'm gonna get filled at the prices I want.  Edit2 Stock price went up and probably hit the high for today so bought 0429 160P for $4.50.

"Facebook parent $Meta earnings are out  here are the numbers","     Meta the company formerly known as Facebook reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.   Earnings per share $2.72 vs $2.56 expected according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts  Revenue $27.91 billion vs $28.2 billion expected according to Refinitiv  Wall Street is also watching other key numbers in the Meta report   Daily Active Users DAUs 1.95 billion expected according to StreetAccount  Monthly Active Users MAUs 2.97 billion expected according to StreetAccount  Average Revenue per User ARPU $9.50 expected according to StreetAccount  Meta is updating investors for the first time since a brutal fourthquarter earnings report in February sent the stock down 26 its worst day ever. Daily active users declined for the first time and the company forecast weakerthanexpected growth.  Firstquarter results should shed light on how macroeconomic trends like inflation and the war in Ukraine may be impacting ad spending on the platform. Growth is expected to come in at 7.8 slipping into the single digits for the first time in Facebooks 10year history as a public company.  In Snaps earnings  week CEO Evan Spiegel said the period proved more challenging than we had expected. Alphabet followed with disappointing numbers on Tuesday largely attributable to weak ad spend on YouTube  Analysts will also be watching to see how Facebook is navigating Apples new app transparency rules which Meta CFO Dave Wehner said last quarter would result in a $10 billion revenue hit this year  Wehner told analysts on the companys earnings call at the time that the figure was an estimate of the overall impact of the iOS changes on 2022 revenue.  We cant be precise on this. Its an estimate he acknowledged adding that the company believes the impact will be substantial.  With the stock down almost 50 this year Metas guidance will be of particular importance to investors looking for signs of optimism. Secondquarter growth is expected to slow to 5.3 according to analysts polled by Refinitiv resulting in revenue of $30.6 billion. Thats down from 56 a year earlier.","negative"

"Nutrien $NTR They help make your food now they help make you money","Hi everyone I have recently entered into a call position on Nutrien $NTR due to technicals and macro news. First a little bit of background Nutrien Ltd. provides crop inputs and services. It offers potash nitrogen phosphate and sulfate products and financial solutions. The company also distributes crop nutrients crop protection products seeds and merchandise products. Basically Nutrien provides a lot of fertilizer needed for industrial scale farming. They are a sizeable company with a market cap of nearly 60 billion and they also pay close to a 2 dividend. The dividend is not why im in this stock however. Im in it mainly for the technical set up.  Daily chartformatpngampautowebpamps744c2bb071e5a5e840028ade5909b741d68eaa1a  First of all Nutrien has seen a drop as of recent. This is most likely a result of the massive run up it has been having since feb. The stock has now bounced on the 50 ema and 38.2 retracement from the run up. This leaves the stock on good grounds to resume its rally.  Hourly chartformatpngampautowebpamps74310544ad8a304f994e5a6b5ddbb5792e09c391  Now looking at the hourly chart the stock is on the cusp of breaking through resistance almost did today but market dropped eod. It is also on the verge of filling a gap of nearly 2.5 which can happen in a days span. Combined with the fact that earnings are around the corner Nutrien is poised to pop. One final thing to mention is being a fertilizer company they stand to benefit from the fertilizer shortage as im sure their pricing has increased. There is also higher demand as crop prices have increased and farming season is underway. That being said I believe they will crush ER.  The June 17 option chain has $200mil or more of OI on the call side. There is 30k OI $15mil on the 105 strike alone. To me this means that a lot of big money is just parked for a rally.

"Would it be plausible to effectively sue the SEC for Poor Price Discovery amp Directional Manipulation of Dark Pools","Suuup   Gimme alllll the opinions for the below.   ampx200B  I have bought many put contracts that expired yet after recent drops such as Netflix's I would have made an absurd gain. Like 30000 gain over principal spent of like 10k as I was rolling almost purely Netflix puts for 2 years  knowing the price was asinine. Unfortunately I lost my job and had to recently stop my strategy which I thought oh well I was wrong. I now see that I was clearly correct   The price dropped so much at once and Gary Gensler stated 95 of retail orders hit dark pools. 95 of buys 95 of sells Or 91 of buys and 99 of sells   His statement was ambiguous on purpose.     These two factors allude that price discovery is simply broken as they don't define the direction of rerouted orders. A company the size of Netflix covered by 1000's of analysts moving this much is just fucking dumb. It seems their price raise amp password crackdown are simply Wallstreet's journalistic answer for the masses to prevent genuine price scrutiny. I am a hater of Netflix but also can acknowledge that their price raises have historically done very well and a password crackdown has minimal downside as you only lose people not currently paying. Maybe ya lose a few others but it is clearly a net benefit.   ampx200B  I feel cheated and I think others should as well as we had some of the brightest minds of wallstreet covering Netflix.   ampx200B  TLDR  Netflix  large corporations should never drop this much on known information.

"Musk Defeats Investor Claims That Teslas SolarCity Deal Was Improper","_mediumsocialampcmpidsocialflowtwitterbusinessamputm_sourcetwitteramputm_contentbusinessamputm_campaignsocialfloworganiccmpidsocialflowtwitterbusinessamputm_sourcetwitteramputm_contentbusinessamputm_campaignsocialfloworganic  Tesla Inc. cofounder Elon Musk wont have to hand over as much as $13 billion in shares of the electric car maker he got in a buyout of SolarCity after a judge found he isnt liable for backing the deal.  Delaware Chancery Court Judge Joseph Slights III concluded the multibillionaire  who recently agreed to buy socialmedia powerhouse Twitter Inc. for $44 billion  didnt improperly use his influence with Tesla directors to prod them to acquire the struggling solar power provider Musk founded with his cousins. Tesla investors demanded Musk return Tesla shares he received as part of the $2.6 billion deal in 2016.  Slights found Musk who served as SolarCitys chairman and largest shareholder at the time of the purchase wasnt improperly on both sides of the deal and didnt ram it through at the expense of Tesla shareholders. Disgruntled investors argued SolarCity was insolvent at the time and not worth the price. They also said Musk failed to properly remove himself from the deals details.  The preponderance of the evidence reveals that Tesla paid a fair price  SolarCity was at a minimum worth what Tesla paid for it and the acquisition otherwise was highly beneficial to Tesla Slights said in his 131page ruling.  The ruling burnishes Musks reputation as a freewheeling entrepreneur who relishes going against the grain as he runs the worlds largest maker of electric cars and spares Musk what could have been a substantial ding even to his vast personal fortune. It also may reinforce the nickname Teflon Elon for winning a case many thought hed lose.  Musk 50 is the worlds richest person with wealth valued at $253 billion. His Twitter acquisition features one of the biggest leveraged buyout deals in history. Hes taking private a 16yearold social networking platform that has become a hub of public discourse and a flashpoint in the debate over online free speech.  In the SolarCity case investors accused Musk of improperly prodding Tesla directors to sign off on the SolarCity buyout at a patently unfair price following a highly flawed process in order to bail out family members Slights said in the ruling.  He was the only Tesla director to challenge the investors claims in court. His board colleagues agreed to a $60 million settlement of allegations by disgruntled shareholders that they were duped into backing the SolarCity deal. That accord was funded by insurance covering Teslas officers and directors.  During a trial last year Musk fenced with investors lawyers over his handling of the SolarCity deal and his predilection for making outrageous statements while running the electriccar maker.  To be honest I dont want to be the boss of anything he said on the stand. I dont want to be CEO. I tried not to be CEO of Tesla but I had to or it would die. I rather hate being a boss. Im an engineer.  In his testimony Musk acknowledged helping hire lawyers to guide the deal through board confirmation and holding weekly meetings to light a fire under the due diligence process.  He maintained that the solar power company was on a solid financial footing but had said in an internal memo the firm needed to solve its liquidity crisis. It turned out SolarCity was hemorrhaging cash and in danger of defaulting on its debt according to court testimony.  But Musk dismissed claims of impropriety having recused himself from deliberations over the deal and been barred from the Tesla directors final approval vote.","negative"

WTFFFF. I Totally did not make that shit up.  This is a MEME Market Now. Insert Captain Philips Meme  When  you trade in a market run by high speed computers that can move  markets do you bet against the Skynet or do you join the Terminators  realistically you would benefit massively by buying stock in Skynet.  Buy Skynet stock.   This is what we have been waiting for.  Exactly 1 year ago SPY reached and bounced down from 420. Then up.   Then 3 months later the SPY  suddenly dropped 4 to bounce off of 420 again.   Then  2.5 months later the SPY dropped again 6 to bounce off of 426 this  time they fucked your puts and plans to buy calls suckers.   Then 3.5 months later the SPY dropped again 12 and guess what price THATS RIGHT YOU GUESSED IT MEME TRADER 420.   Then  up we went and dropped again suddenly in a month FEB. AND THUS began  our BEAR FLAG formation...OR is it a DOUBLE BOTTOM. But what price did  we drop to this time   Open 411 bounce to 428 to close. WHY  because war so I excuse the over shoot but it compensated. Next  retrace to golden pocket and form top of BEAR FLAG.   Then It dropped  again exactly 2 months later 1 year from original 420 TO GUESS WHAT  FUCKING PRICE 420 U MOTHER FATHERSSS. That's right.  BEAR FLAG FULLY FORMED Touching perfect.  WHYYYY should you BUY IDK because this is a MEME market now Fuck your puts gay bear   Actually It might be a Massive BEAR FLAG so SELL IT DOESNT MATTER.  The point is that this IS the price we have waited for. That moment in the market AGAIN.   WALLSTREET  knows that you like to trade MEMEs only. SO how do Market Makers work  They bring the price OVER and OVER again to the most traded Price.  BECAUSE MMs need you to TRADE. They make their money on the spreads and  volume.   SO we look at Volume Profile and where is the most traded  amount That's right you guess it.... 435438. Well what the F you want  me to do this isn't some made up shit. You idiots keep buying the dip  before we even get to the bottom of the dip at 420. Morons.  So what can YOU do to help yourself IDFK this is NFA.  I  have an IRON BUTTERFLY as far dated as I could afford it. I will cycle  it probably half way through the 3 month cycle or when we reach 469  again. WHY because between 465 and 470 is where another bulk of trading  took place. The MMs Know that.   SO either we Head UP there now     because Apple and Amazon are going to kill it i actually have no idea  they might just destroy the market who knows. Inflation. PCE is Friday  and FOMC is next Wednessday. SO I think sideways trading till then at  least   OR we DROP into a 25 to 40 CRASH.   THE 3rd Possibility is that we go to a brand new high of 500 by middle of JULY.   Why July Read on weary reader.  Last and Final Note.   GUESS WHEN the BEAR FLAG CHANNEL RESISTANCE line HITS 469.   THAT'S  RIGHT you guessed it MIDDLE OF JULY Just like 1 year prior to  that when the market took 3.69 DUMP on the 3rd week of JULY finished  dump on next Monday  So it is  likely that in a market where everything has dropped to NEW LOWS EXCEPT a  select few stocks the market is either BOUND to BOUNCE off of this  fabled 420 OR is it DOOMED to be RESET. I have a firm belief that the  market can no longer handle a drop below 420. We are in the clouds it  is either MOON or SPLAT now. Below 420  margin calls and liquidations.  So  do YOU think that the Fed or MMs or whoever the F controls the markets  will let the market CRASH or take it to a new HIGH because they know  everyone's trading habits and patterns and access to everyone's money  plus who knows how much more money might suddenly be printed for  stimulus checks or cancelling student loans.

"Germany PPI index  maximum increase since 1949 Once again about inflation","The situation is getting more and more interesting and fun. EU energy groups agree to pay in rubles for Russian gas.  Reasons The PPI index cost inflation in Germany soared by 30.9 in March compared to March 2021. This is the maximum increase since 1949 and then let me remind you there was a postwar famine and a shortage of energy resources in Germany.  Energy prices jumped by 83.8 last month including natural gas rose by 144.8. Food has risen in price by 12.2...  Of course PPI does not always go headtohead with CPI consumer inflation. Sometimes inflation becomes less due to the loss of business margins. But anyway 30 inflation at a key rate of 0 is something surreal ....It is completely incomprehensible who will need such a EURO ...   Meanwhile EU energy groups agree to fulfill Putin's conditions on Russian gas  this is the headline of the Financial Times editorial published today. According to the newspaper within a few days the largest energy companies in Germany Austria Hungary and Slovakia including German Uniper and Austrian OMV are preparing to open ruble accounts with Gazprombank in Switzerland..   formatpjpgampautowebpamps53e7572bc573882dd609ed8aa4914210104e3dc0","negative"

"OTM options and IV leading up to earnings","I've noticed that people take advantage of IV leading up to earnings and I am wondering how that works. For example Amazon's AMZN earnings is tomorrow 0428 AH. ITM and ATM options are incredibly expensive due to volatility. Ex. one 2760C 0429 is worth about $9.6k 2DTE. And so I've seen people buy far OTM options hold until earnings and sell it hopefully for a profit.   Now the 2000P 0429 is worth about $95 with an IV of 179. Is this something that one would purchase tomorrow and sell before EOD Or is it too late and should have been bought earlier Would the intraday movement of the stock matter since its way OTM and essentially we are taking advantage of IV leading up to earnings. I imagine this would be absolutely worthless after earnings since it expires 0429 and there's likely no way that AMZN would even drop that low.   I have no positions but would appreciate any insight on this strategy thanks.","neutral"
"THE HOUSING MARKET IS GOING TO GRIND TO A HALT....","The current dynamics in the housing market are unlike anything seen in decades if ever. Prices are at all time highs supply is scarce rates are rising and refi activity has plummeted. Housing faces a set of headwinds AND tailwinds at the same time creating a pressure cooker in a very important sector of the economy.  The median price of an existing home sold in March was up 15 percent to a record of $375k. Total homes for sale at the end of last month was 950K a 2 month supply of inventory. The rates on a 30 year fixed mortgage have gone up about 200 basis points since the beginning of the year from slightly above 3 to over 5 currently. Refi activity has plunged almost 70 in the last year.  The opinions of the housing market range from one extreme to another. Some are calling for a complete bust as prices have reached unsustainable levels and can't possibly go any higher. Others look at lack of supply and an economy flush with cash and see only continued price appreciation especially in the face of break neck inflation. The reality in my opinion will likely be a crushing slow down in any activity related to housing.  With interest rates at 5.35 most homeowners who could benefit from a refi usually a 1 rate improvement have either done it already or it no longer makes sense to. This is after a paltry 25 basis point hike by the FED. Once a couple of 50 basis point moves happen and rates hit 6.57 refi volume is going to dry up. One year ago refinances made up 61 of total mortgage activity today that number is 35 and has been decreasing at almost double digit levels for months.  On the purchase side mortgage applications are down 17 in the last year and were down 8.3 week over week. Pending sales have been down 5 months in a row. March sales were down 4.5 and listings were down 9.5. Activity on the buying side has been hampered by increased rates and increased prices at the same time. A 1 increase in interest rates typically equates to a loss of 10 in buying power. Rates have gone up over 2 YTD and prices are up almost 20 in the  last year. Buyers who were already fighting an uphill battle are getting pummeled on both sides of the equation.  The stress in the purchase and refi sides of the housing market is starting to show itself in terms of how deals are financed. Cash has always been king in real estate and is no different now with 28 of sales being cash. The good old ARM has made its way back into the picture currently making up 9 of total loan count and 17 of dollar volume. This doesn't portend a 2008 like collapse by any means but it is an interesting development. A 5 year ARM is currently about 1 lower than a fixed rate making it an option in a rising price and rate world.  Housing inventory countrywide is estimated to be 4 million units short of demand. The CEO of the National Association of Home Builders NAHB just came out appealing to the government for help to stave off a recession in housing as the market continues to slow down on all fronts. There is a real irony to this as the homebuilders have already plotted a course through these times. A look at building permits shows that permits for single family homes are 4.8 in the last month. Compare that to permits for buildings with 5 units which are up 10.9. Housing starts show a similar trend with single family starts 1.7 while starts for construction of 5 units are up 7.5. There are no signs on the horizon that inventory issues are going to change.   The net result of this will be a massive slow down in housing. This may lead to price drops but prices may also keep going up due to cash purchases and lack of supply. Overall volume is going to drop to levels that will make it hard for any type of significant move in price either way. Large buying volume relative to supply is what is needed to keep prices ripping like they have been for years. But that volume is shrinking fast. Conversely large selling volume relative to supply is needed to lower prices in any meaningful way. But who is going to sell their house that has a sub 4 rate to buy another equally inflated house at over 5 For those reasons I don't see any scenario that housing doesn't just slowly grind to a halt....","negative"

"42722 SPY APPLE QQQ VIX Daily TA","    Going to keep this brief because Ive unfortunately got a sick kiddo at home who so kindly passed it along to me. Gonna try to rest up before tomorrow so I can be on my game. But we had some fairly big things happen today honestly.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampsdff01842200b28d7610eb06435a207f2d531e0ba  In the moment its impossible to tell but we essentially just had a massive $6.52 range day today. While also maintaining a slight bull channel that broke as you can see ill show zoomed out below the current bear channel we have been in since last Wednesday. Thats a big win for the bulls   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps57cf93469c87cc081c8fa23573e19fe5edc73e21  For those that follow me you know I am not one to scream manipulation or anything like that. The markets are erratic and in the end we are playing a risky game that most people fail at. I believe only 0.02 of all people in the world are professional successful day traders if my statistics are correct.   Anyways this week has once again been humbling. We need to remember quick profits are king. When we hold through these massive violent days and swings we are just getting ate alive. We also have to accept a bad entry. I struggle with that today especially willing to admit my entry was bad and help a call to 80 that I was lucky enough to recover for 11 before the 2nd dip of the day. But I then got stuck in a call that I now have to carry and definitely dont like the idea of carry it over night. But in the end the choices we make have consequences. When green wins the MM win. We have to remember we have to play their game. If they want violent wild swings thats fine We just take profits early  So lets talk about the fuckery of the day today.   Overnight we had MSFT killing it and of course Google sucking air through a straw. Spy opened up very green this morning and just took off immediately reaching 422.02 by 945a. It was pretty arguable that with the VIX opening at 31.11 after closing at 33.77 the day before and dropping all the way to 29.89 at open that we were going to see one hell of a bull run. At these VIX levels a 23 green day is just as easy if not easier to accomplish then a red 2.9 we saw yesterday.   Well then 10am came and we saw Spy go from its HOD all the way to 415.01 within 30 minutes time. Thats a total of 1.7 drop or a $6 drop in a very short period of time. The VIX also spiked from 29.89 to 32.77 at the same time. And what caused this arguably unnatural sell off Thats a great question. At the time the only notable news was that expected home sales had a massive miss. But you will not sit here and tell me that after 3 weeks of the markets not giving a flying F about CPI PMI or any other actually important economic data that they all of a sudden cared today Sus...          Then the lovely which if you didnt catch it here it is fb oopsies.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampscb7e9c2f3014e50cb9cf5653ec4b09e9db357eae  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampsda53071790cea012f152748b115cca532a8f632c  Yes you are reading that correct thats BLOOMBERG fricken Bloomberg accidentally tweeting a massive miss for META earnings. And not only that But they tweeted the INCORRECT data yeah that data was old. How does one manage to post not only incorrect data but also post it in the middle of the day when no one ever releases earnings yeah a little sus if you ask me.   Now why was this important Ah yes let me tell you why So the market had opened bullish af. Tanked on the bullshit at 1015am and FINALLY recovered all the way back to green and made a new HOD Yay SPY. Well right after making the HOD is when that piece dropped at 1pm. And that changed the whole dynamic for the rest of the day. I dont like to scream manipulation or anything but im telling you that someone fucked with the market on purpose today and they won. Oh yeah someone just so conveniently LOADED to the tits with puts RIGHT BEFORE the new dropped sus I mean come on.   Overall after SPY recovered from its morning dip it was setting the stage full steam ahead for an afternoon rally and I have no doubts it was shooting for 425426 EOD. But that meta new not only tanked meta itself to be down 5 at one point but took the rest of the market down with it. I know nothing will ever come from this but this is the type of day that breaks the spirits of a day trader.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampsb73e55cd522928c7a143546c643f6f3734e17b97  So where are we   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps5ce2d9a2245054e95c6bfefb84ea0367cadf9f1c  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps1525667c63346434bda1d4f628e1a5fb00641f4b  Well meta absolutely KILLED IT tonight on earnings. I called it out in my server but I did not play it myself but I called it out that meta was going to be a call not put play. It got beat down so aggressively over the last week there was no way they would tank it anymore.   Spy as you can see is reacting VERY positively to that news.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps450ba653ce6a03603b232b1f5a9ae3b91d2c9cbe  The daily chart on SPY has never looked so bullish. I wanna point out the blue arrows to you. So you can see I highlight two from March and then today. What do you see there Especially the one from March 8th the first blue arrow you see a massive sell off that ended at 415 AND had a long ass wicked candle. What did it do the next day It rallied like no one elses business.   So for instance March 8th closed at 0.76 with an intraday range of 2.9 or $12 of movement. The next day it had a 2.68 green day.   March 14th closed at 0.73 with an intraday range of 2.1 or $8.76 of movement. The next day it had a 2.20 green day.  Those of you that follow me know ive been having a working theory of a sideways channel from 415 to 458 for a little while now. This would secure that channel with now 4 supports. Yes someones gonna scream it cant be a channel if a candle breaks it Well it can actually. Its called an outlier. And that candle right there is from the day the Russia war took off. So thats really an outlier.  Now the resistance we have 7 candles rejecting off of it with two outliers above it. Something I am definitely watching for sure.   One thing I do see and know though is that 415 yesterday and today and last month held as great support. Tomorrow which we are above now resistance will be 420. From there we paint the path to 428 which is the daily 8ema and next major resistance. Believe it or not I truly think its doable tomorrow. It would take a large 2.5 day but thats honestly easily obtainable.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps2032d9004a32a96abb8668b5b4f7eccdee08c3db  The VIX never really found its groove today. It supports the sideways range day for sure as we just couldnt really get a direction established and after a very strong ADX yesterday it was very weak all day today. However its important to note just how high the VIX is. The vix does not usually stay in this range. Its happy place is down close to 1920 for the last few months. The VIX is more like to unravel from these levels and cause massive bull runs when it does. Arguably at open today when the VIX immediately dropped and spy rocketed too that was setting the tone for the day. But it was unable to hold below the 30 level and reach 28. With Meta killing earnings and 32 being clearly the top for VIX right now I think we will see this unwind tomorrow and will see the bull rally.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps9c1aa62485dee2eeffc0e1e6fe9b8c0a807b9671  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps78e69d67554a66438d0e9e9b82daf12f10b2a46b  Apple is still well within its bear channel right now. However it bounced off support today once again at 155. The daily and 15min bear channel supports were tested and held perfectly today. I didnt even have to adjust the yellow bear channel thats how perfect it was.   Now you note the two candles highlighted on apple and yes you guessed it they coincide perfectly with the SPY candles that resulted in rallies So lets dig into these.   March 14th Apple finished down 2.66 with an intraday range of 2.67 or $4.02 of movement it was followed by a massive green day that was 2.97 green with an intraday range of 3.45 or $5.19 of movement.   Today had a 0.15 finished with a total range of 2.83 or $4.41 of movement. So very similar days and ranges. It will be very interesting to see if tomorrow we get that bull rally we are all waiting for.   The markets MAY make us wait until apple earnings but I have a feeling we are going to rally tomorrow off meta earnings and will look for a follow through rally after Apple beats earnings. I dont think personally that amazon is going to beat earnings at all. And I dont think the markets will care either to be honest. Look at google today left in the dust 3.75 and was red all day long even when the markets were at the highs of day.   We will find out in the morning when we wake up how pre market and Europe digests everything but again if I ever was a betting man despite all the fuckery afoot on a markets direction tomorrow being green I feel fairly confident in.   The one thing that will change that is if markets for some reason dont digest overnight meta well or the VIX for some ungodly reason spikes back to 3234 before open.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampsb88d321b399d449ef1e97236efe07972311a5748  I wasnt going to add QQQ tonight just cause im running outta steam here and my heads killing me but I wanted to point out the exact same candle set up on QQQ that SPY and Apple has And see how wild that swing up was the next day. Just something to keep in mind.   10 challenge  This week honestly has been really rough for me. I took a major loss Monday once again on a bs reversal that was like 1 in 30minutes and yesterday finally recovered to green on the week. Intraday today I had a good call in the morning for 11. I then entered another call at the perfect moment before spy dropped the 1.5. I with conviction or stupidity held from 80 all the way to 5 to 40 back to 10 before I finally sold right before the 1pm sell off. That was a rough time for sure. I also then took another 2dte call that went against me and I got out a 1 thankfully.   As you can see I ended up closing my MSFT lotto for 10 it was a very small position. At open I was up about 5 and then it immediately went red so I just bailed while I could. Of course had I held I woulda been up a lot when it hit that 56 at one point. But I had no belief it would rally that hard intraday.   So thats the good. The bad is I also entered some calls around 230 when I expected the bull trend to continue and immediately saw a drop and red action. So I am currently holding those right now over night. I am holding way move over night then I care to do but I think by EOD tomorrow I should be able to exit everything green.   Call msft lotto 3 dte 10  Call 0dte 11  Call 0dte 11  Call 2dte 1  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpampsb5f466edc0124c1c637cf5f9bcc6951bfe009d54  ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps0313978b2a1e448171b23afd5d6822ed53e703ac  Realistically I dont have too far to go on these For the 2dte 422C on spy I only need to see 424 intraday tomorrow to see any green. That is very much so doable for SPY tomorrow.     The 428c lotos from last week are pretty much smoked I need something like 434 by Friday which is pretty doubtful. My goal will be to close those EOD tomorrow or intraday around 50 if I get the chance.   The Apple 165C has a breakeven of 161.3 which is very doable for apple in one day. Itll be tough but its doable. Depending on how im feeling and where those are tomorrow night and what market is doing I MAY hold the apple as a lotto over night for earnings. I havent decided yet.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps4864df80d99e5df06eb5361eebd2396c95603a43  And of course cant forget the hyperwheel that still haunts me as I sleep at night. The good news is im holding the futures contracts still so as long as we get some green under neath us we will be good to go and I will quickly see profits return there. But that 14 hurst a lot to see.","positive"

"How a rogue VIX spike last week predicted the current market turmoil. Update","gtPt. 1  42022   gt   gtThe rogue VIX spike that leaked out today to spark that morning selloff has happened three other times since Corona on green market days. In all three other instances the spike has been followed by a 20 volatility increase within two trading days afterwards.   gt   gtI started to notice a pattern related to the rogue VIX spikes that will appear completely out of nowhere to cause market selloffs before getting pushed back down by the Fed to keep the markets healthy.   In the three other times that these have suddenly leaked out on green market days there has been a VIX increase of 1820 occur within 2 trading days afterwards.  ampx200B  gtPt. 2  42122   gt   gtUpdate That rogue VIX spike appearing the middle of a green market yesterday has foretold of major volatility increase 4 times now.   gt   gtUpdate to my post yesterday  I recognized something behind the scenes during trading yesterday that I had only observed 3 other times since the corona recovery began.  A  rogue VIX spike anomaly that seemingly leaks out mid day during an otherwise healthy green market.  It appears briefly enough to disrupt the entire market momentarily before getting smothered back down minutes later.     It has only ever happened 3 other times to us during a green market in that manner and had been followed immediately by a major volatility crash to the market.   gt   gtIt would  now seem this is somewhat of an undeniable feature not a glitch as It has now happened 4 times under those exact conditions and every single time it has foretold us that a major volatility increase about to take place within the markets.  Pt. 3  Volatility Suppression and Patterns  Here's my assessment of the situation how I picked up on this strange pattern and what I have concluded is happening.   So what is happening  Why would this occur  First let's get you caught up to what VIX even is  ampx200B  gtThe Volatility Index VIX measures investors confidence of market health and signals the level of fear or stress in the stock marketusing the indexes as a proxy for the broader marketand hence is known as the Fear Index. The higher the VIX the greater the level of fear and uncertainty in the market because of this a major increase to VIX will cause markets to systematically sell off in computerized responsive trading.  You can start to gather from this relationship as to why VIX climbing unchecked at every COVID news update could be problematic to an already tense market in recovery.  The Federal Reserve recognized this importance as well and set in motion a plan to prevent it from continuing to repeat itself.   By June of 2020 it was apparent that the monthly volatility cycles were upending investors and was going to spiral into a larger full blown crash.   As part of the Fed's recovery outline a market recovery team was to be created affectionately known to us as the plunge protection team.   Their algos began to routinely show themselves during trading to prop up the major indexes and provided price support to entire sectors worth of companies stock so our then feeble markets didn't appear outwardly sick in what became known to many as fed pump mornings fed pumps money printer go brr etc..    This set in motion a dangerous policy of the Reserve algorithmically suppressing VIX to clamp it down and in the process engineer false market confidence to prevent skittish investors from fleeing the markets at the first sign of trouble.  All of these efforts were unprecedented it gave them a level of access and control to our financial markets that had never been seen and the unbridled ability to dictate much of the narrative driving the perception of our recovering economy. From that point on an all out market protection war to save us from ourselves was put underway.  And it worked a little too well.  It led to one of the strongest continuous bull markets in modern history and set the stage for that VShaped recovery that we were so promised.. but at what cost   The cost of lying to the markets falsely propping it up with strings and cheating volatility as a means to suppress the truth of how bad the situation really was to everyone.  And in the process enticing confident investors to pile into positions with margin debt at levels never before seen.  The suppression of volatility creates a debt to the market that must be paid.  It was in these efforts of market control and suppression that myself and others began to notice cracks leaking out that could not be explained.   The exaggerated midday price movements into end of day collapses pump like market behavior inexplicable microcrashes that dotted the recovery at every few month intervals and of course the questionable manipulation of VIX that seemingly defied all market health indicators.   It became apparent early on that clamping down VIX was something the Fed prized themselves on controlling and for that reason I began watching it just as much as I did my own stocks.  My trading grid contained VIX in the 1 spot followed by my long positionsinterested stocks and it was because of this  setup that I began to pick up on certain irregularities in its' price movement and correlating the effects of these movements on the market as a whole.  To truly understand why these rogue  spike movements jumped out at me you must understand that VIX has very unique price pattern tendencies and normally travels very naturally under live trading and has reactionary impulses that correspond to the current market health ie. climbs during red markets movement that will typically begin gradually while following a back and forth tug and pulling both directions before the next linear climb or drop interval starts  With the anomaly spikes when they begin you would witness an almost vertical launch formation and price climb happen in just minutes.  It would skip entire intervals of numbers per second ie. 11.2  11.3  11.8  12.1 etc.  As the spike was forming for these couple minutes the market goes into a state of paralytic shock and most every index starts to decline and sell off immediately in response.  The rogue price jump was always such that it went against the ongoing sentiment and movement of the live market and currently trending VIX direction large percentage jumps occurring in the midst of a green market which defied implicit behavior tendencies.  In addition there was always an immediate and successful attempt to crash the spike back down to regain market stability for the day to calm peoples nerves before giving the market the full VIX dose over the trading days immediately afterwards.  The only way you can witness these is to experience them while trading and observe the market wide effect and price paralysis that occurs when its forming.   If you were watching your stocks every day during Corona recovery markets you definitely experienced this.  Whether you noticed the relationship to VIX or not.  Why it matters  In the past when we have observed this behavior under healthy green markets it has signaled the point at which the markets are about to incur the volatility debt that the Fed has been sparing us from through their market control measures.  Where it goes from here or how long this market uncertainty lasts is unclear.   What is clear is that VIX has a long overdue climb to fulfill and a debt with the markets to reckon with.  It will be slowed down and even dialed back for periodic intervals to maintain stability and produce green markets but its' climb will likely persist as the pressure it creates is released in a controlled manner.  Which I do not believe has fully happened in spite of the pain this past week has wrought.  Position UVXY calls will be rewarded but should be treated with respecttake profits  and entered at appropriate times.  Puts will print as this process unfolds and the markets reconcile with the true state of affairs.  ampx200B  TLDR  The tape and glue that the fed has employed as a means to prop up a sickly market will spring a leak occasionally showing us how bad of shape the boat is really in the day before it takes on water.   An unintentional side effect of the Feds efforts in suppressing VIX and propping up our markets has berthed a type of early warning alarm that seems to go off in the days before giving you a chance to get a head of it with your trades.  As this most recent one did for me with UVXY calls.","negative"
"Trojan Condom Maker Cautions About Potential Recession Risk","Bloomberg  The maker of Arm amp Hammer baking soda and Trojan condoms cautioned about a possible recession in its firstquarter earnings report.  Church amp Dwight Co. told investors Thursday that its well positioned for a potential recessionary environment given that 40 of our portfolio is considered value products. The U.S. economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter with gross domestic product contracting at a 1.4 annual rate.  Consumers and businesses are spending at a healthy clip the Commerce Departments figures showed Thursday but a swollen trade deficit was a big drag on growth. Church amp Dwights cautionary language stands out because few consumer companies have brought up a recession in their earnings reports. Several have pointed to strong underlying demand despite inflation.  A recession is generally defined as at least two consecutive quarters of negative change in GDP. Economists put the chance of a recession in the next 12 months at 27.5 according to 40 respondents in a Bloomberg survey in early April.  Church amp Dwight has raised prices on 80 of its products over the past year and plans more increases for fabric care and cat litter in July but they havent been enough to stem rapidly rising costs.   The company said it would incur an additional $85 million in expenses for 2022 primarily due to higher oil and transportation prices bringing its fullyear inflation forecast to $240 million. That will result in earnings per share growth of 4 at the low end of the prior guidance.

Okay retards ik google just missed earnings and is bleeding down to 2.3k. I also know lots of you fuckers lost 10s of thousands on HMHC. Good news for you all and myself its summer and theres lots of work during the summer. GET A JOB OR TWO. Now you have till June to get your play money and DCA into googlebasically  buy a bit every week or when it goes down from ur paycheck. Now by July 16 your goal is to get at least one stock of googleafter the split u will have 20. Lets say it stays the same price at 2.3k you will have 20 shares each worth 115. Last time google was this low it was when it first became a ticker Also if you retards want to buy options and gamble I think a good bet would be the 3.3k options for August 19 2022 as they carry the most risk to rewards ratio.  Now after split the price is likely to double within a few weeks to a month. Why Because it hasnt dropped below 1k in 5 years and its going to 115. When it reaches 230 or double ur price per sharedepending on when u started DCA or how well u did sell half and get ur money back. Now u have 10 shares that are likely to go back to 1k in about 3 years and you got ur initial investment back.

"Gather around and let me tell you why SPY will go below 400 soon","Alright listen up retards. Im a terrible trader and everything Im about to say is most likely nothing new but definitely nothing old.   1. Fed tightening. You all know this and they have minutes next week. Most likely a .5 hike putting us at .75 and then guidance on future hikes. On top of that rolling off the fed balance sheet. They are talking about doing this but we will see what happens next week.   2. This is basically an extension of number 1 but the fed tightening is causing dollar strength. Generally when this happens assets and equities go down.   3. This plays off number 2. The strength of the dollar relative to other currencies is getting high. Other nations such as China and Japan are getting weaker currencies relative to the dollar. This is bad because they are the main buyers of US treasuries esp Japan. You have a weaker currency and that means you get less treasuries for your money meaning purchases will go down on treasuries. This means bond yields will go up.  4. Debt to GDP. The amount of debt we have to GDP is over 120. The numbers came out today that GDP is lowering. Our debt hasnt lowered. So Im guessing our debt to gdp is going higher. The fed will definitely account for this in their next meeting and imo have no choice but do something about that.   All in all the fed tightening can not go above 1.25 before breaking something. Which means they have the hike in May of .5 and then another of .5 and then thatll be the top. Reason being if you look at where they got to with every other tightening cycle it has been about half of the previous cycle. In 2018 they got to 2.5 before they had to change direction.  During all of this tightening cycle you will see the stock market continue to go down until some black swan or big event occurs. Then due to this event the fed will have no choice but to reverse course.  When the fed does this it will mean everything will go to the absolute moon.   There is no timeframe I have for any of this other than before the end of the year. I am not giving anyone any advice and I am not providing sources on any of this information.

"AstraZeneca looks bullish Technical Analysis.","Hello everyone  A few days ago I posted my views on GME but it apparently got deleted I don't know why whatever be it I'm back with another Technical analysis of mine would love to hear what you guys have to say about it.  ampx200B  Script Name AstraZeneca PLC  TICK AZN  View Bullish  ampx200B  Weekly timeframe view   1. AstraZeneca had a breakout with increasing volumes recently and subsequently it hit a new alltime high. 2. After hitting the alltime high AZN fell for 2 weeks straight and this week it has taken support from the previous resistance levels thus confirming that the resistance has now become a support zone. The volume confirmation solidifies this view.  AZN on Weekly Timeframeformatpngampautowebpamps37639726a7af0306d69e1daef77c337f2c799f78  Daily timeframe view   1. If we slap in a Fibonacci from the last low to the recent high we can see that the price has taken support from 38.2 levels. 2. Not only that but we can also see that the 38.2 level coincides with the 50EMA not to be mentioned that it also coincides with the weekly timeframe support zone. 3. It is safe to say that if the market remains bullish AZN can surely hit a new alltime high very soon.  AZN on Daily Timeframeformatpngampautowebpamps9c053e4b7998b2e3fdd32e440510618e2a2e5fcd  Points to be noted   1. It might seem that my technical analysis on AZN is a bit late since in the last trading session it already had a good bullish movement but what I believe is that yesterday's movement might give a little pullback since it might have been due to the results.  Disclaimers   1. Please perform your own analysis before taking any positions. 2. Please let me know if I'm violating any sub rules by posting such analysis.

WSB is bearish  Those two are never right NEVER and they now both agree on something. This to me says shorts will go TITS UP  A third reason thats more analytical is they released press news abt layoffs. The classical release bad news before ER to cause a squeeze scenario. Ive seen it when PTON announced the production delayshalt before ER then they went and rocketed right after ER on a huge short squeeze.   My positions I am broke cuck both financially and mentally so Im not sure what to buy. Im down to my last $50ish dollars and Im thinking of putting $20 on spreads or one naked call.

"The 2022 Real Estate Collapse is going to be Worse than the 2008 One and Nobody Knows About It","There's going to be a lot of text here so all you smooth brain apes who are on reddit a text based website yet are still to retarded to read can skip to the end where there will be a very short summary a bottle of milk from your mother and a blankie.  First lets talk about the part of the real estate market that's gonna go bust that everyone knows about or at least that people who pay attention to this shit or read my previous DDs know about CMBS.  This is the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Market.  These are loans on commercial buildings that have been securitized bundled and sold to investors.  The following is an explanation of the CMBS issues I wrote for another DD over six months ago  The CMBS Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Bomb  This one is a bit different from the mess we had in 2008 with MBS mortgage backed securities because it's a different market with different rules and it's a smaller total market than MBS.  That said the problems here might actually be worse. There is a company called Ladder Capital formed out of the remnants of the Bear Stearns bond department that has struck an unusual deal with Dollar Store and they have a LOT of properties that are very very much coasting on made up mortgages. I could easily write like three pages on this one partnership alone but I'll just summarize instead and say these people learned absolutely nothing from 2008 except that it was a profitable scam that carried no jail time.  To understand just how bad the CMBS mess is you need to understand how CMBS' work. At first glance they're similar to regular MBS it's a bundle of tens or hundreds of mortgages for commercial properties they're divided into tranches usually six and the lowest tranches pay out the highest yields but also fail first. And now things get a little complex so I'm going to simplify like crazy here but this is the most important part to understand why this is all going to blow up.  A commercial building is an income generating property it's market value is derived from how much income it generates. The bank lending you the money will want you to put up some amount of collateral for the loan. If rents go up the amount of collateral you have to post goes down. If rent goes down the amount of collateral you have to post goes UP. Now the weird thing about CMBS loans is that if only half your building is rented you can just pay half your mortgage and whatever you owe for the other half of the building just gets added to the end of the loan. Now say you can't rent out the empty half of your building and you want to renegotiate the terms of your loan rather than just keep adding debt to the back of your loan. Well this is where the CMBS comes into play because all those different tranches The investors behind them have different incentives the guys at the lowest tranches don't want you to modify the loan because that means losses and they take those losses first while the guys in the highest tranche want to modify the loan because it generates more income for them and they're not eating any losses. Unfortunately for you in most CMBS agreements you need a supermajority of 7080 of the votes to get a loan modification.  So to lower rents to market rates and get the building rented out since you can't get a loan modification you the landlord have to write a check to the bank to make up the difference between the value of the building at the old higher rental rate and the value of the building at the new lower rate. Or you can just do nothing get an extra write off for your taxes and hope some sucker comes in and rents at the higher price or a different sucker comes along and buys the place from you making it their problem. This is why you'll see so many empty storefronts with ridiculous asking prices that the landlords won't budge on  it's because they can't.  I really really skimmed just the teeniest top of the surface on this subject but basically all those CMBS notes that are super toxic start coming due in March of 2022 and they're going to absolutely detonate the commercial property market. Many banks and investment groups will be destroyed when these go bad just like in 2008.  Video of Empty Stores in NYC  This is a video from a guy who just walked around downtown NYC showing all the empty stores and how the place basically looks like a dead mall now.  TIMEFRAME March 2022  Well I said March 2022 was when these shit CMBS notes were going to start detonatingcausing problems.  Let's check shall we  ampx200B  God that's a big shampoo commercial.formatpngampautowebpamps61734dd411a82c7f1ab2c6d68b750336a9454b9d  You see that little spike at the end of the head and shoulders before it really dives to new all time lows  Yeah that's the last day of February 2022.  Ok so that's 13 of the US real estate market what about the 23rds of the market that's residential  Well this is where it gets weird and how everyone including me kept missing it.  I've written before about the issues with the US housing market  housing units relative to population has actually increased over the last decade while homeownership rates have dropped and prices have skyrocketed.  Everyone who looks at the residential market thinks its being bought by residents and that all the people buying today are actually qualified buyers with good credit scores and jobs and such.  And that is true for all the people buying houses.  There is not a repeat of the 2008 subprime debacle with NINJA No Income No Job no Assets loans.  What is new  and whenever you get a financial crisis it's always ALWAYS driven in large part by a new type of financial instrument read debt  is the sheer number of homes being bought up by with cash and it's inferred these are all institutions and foreigners.  For example about $90 billion in US real estate was bought by foreigners in 2021.  Wall Street however blew that away hitting as high as 1in7 of all homes and 1in2 of all apartments.  Now people look at that record institutionalforeigner buying and think it's the explanation but the truth is even with those crazy numbers 6in7 homes and 1in2 apartments are still being bought by regular people often with again cash.  These purchases are frequently referred to as cash buys because the buyer just pays the seller cash.  However they don't actually have piles of cash lying around in freighters to pay for this stuff.  They take out loans. Specifically they take out loans on their equity assets.  Now this is where it starts getting sticky because institutions are not buying these houses and apartments as residences they're buying them as income generating properties.  In traditional home mortgage loans there are two things assessed the value of the house which acts as collateral for the loan and the borrower's ability to pay back said loan via wages or assets.  It's a relatively simple twofactor risk analysis.  Now let's look at what risks the Wall Street owned rental homes are subject to income generatedrental rates housing values stockderivative values interest rates urban planning crime rates and overall market returns.  So basically the money being loaned is getting assessed on a onefactor risk analysis value of assets under management AUM of the borrower.  But then that money is getting used to buy a whole bunch of housesapartments and all of a sudden it's subject to a whole horde of other risks and the original risk profile is more useless than you are with your compensated evening companionship after a couple drinks.  There's one other thing I haven't mentioned yet that's huge and the reason Wall Street never really messed around with buying up everyone's house before the 2008 crash.  And it's a big one  Liquidity.  More specifically  Liquidity of Assets.  Lemme say that one more time for the folks in the back recovering from barnyard animal sex gone wrong hearing loss   Liquidity of Assets  Wut mean  Glad you asked 'tard.  Liquidity of Assets LoA basically means how easy or hard it is to sell an asset.  Now one of the reasons wall street hedge funds and investment banks can do things like leverage up at 37.51 the theoretical max level they use or say 2001 the level Goldman is at according to the last 13F filing I read is because the money is backed by securities and derivatives and other financial instruments which are extremely liquid.  So if things go tits up like the Titanic the lender can force a sell off of this stuff very quickly to get their money back.  Now in reality this isn't true or Credit Suisse and Nomura wouldn't still be dragging around Archegos bags from last year and Bill Hwang couldn't have pulled a Reddit meme and avoided margin calls by not answering the phone yes that really actually in real life happened.  But in theory it is.  Now housing  Housing is illiquid as fuck.  It takes a lot of time and effort to sell a house.  Or to buy one.  There are special rules and whatnot from the federal government about what kind of collateral and stuff you need for a residential house.  2008 was so bad because the banks basically ignored all of those.  After 2008 one of the few things the government sortof did fix was tightening up lending standards for retail regular people so everyone who's looking at the last crash sees that retail borrowers aren't overleveraged with bad loans and subprime and thinks it can't happen again.  But all those rules and whatnot get ignored if the buyer is paying cash.  This is the financial equivalent of the military expression Generals always fight the last war.  The massive use of marginequity backed loans by both retail and institutions to buy property has taken two separate markets the liquidvolatile equity market and the illiquidstable housing market and stitched them together like a human centipede with dogshit wrapped in catshit debt passing back and forth into one market that is unequally liquid and extremely price volatile.  If you need proof that this is what's happening lemme help you out with some charts that illustrate my point  This is US Margin debt over the last few years  formatpngampautowebpampsd42eb68f00af67a6afad37582123d3277c940409  Now lets compare it to US home prices over the same period  formatpngampautowebpampsd60e5cbd4091a43a3e437532cb9fa414d4a345d9  So basically we've got loans on inflated assets fueling loans on other inflated assets.  This is feedback loop that goes parabolic.. then crashes hard.  You can see the margin debt coming down and forming the first valley before it goes back up a little to complete the Head and Shoulders pattern then drills down into the center of the earth.  Because housing is illiquid it's going to lag that drop but as you can see from the price curve leveling off it's getting ready to do the same thing.  Now we know that there are a ton of loans using inflated volatile collateral on illiquid inflated assets.  And this is a certified bad thing.  But the coming death spiral of equityasset sales isn't the only giant elephant in the room everyone is ignoring.  I'm talking of course about Evergrande in specific and Chinese property bonds in general.  The list of Chinese real estate developers that aren't paying their employees debts bonds or suppliers is actually longer than you pretend your wang is so we'll just use Evergrande as a proxy for the whole lot of them.  Evergrande hasn't made hundreds of millions of dollars of interest payment on bonds since September.  A couple weeks ago they failed to pay the principal payment on a maturing bond to the tune of $2.1 Billion.  So you'd think that means their debt is junk and they've defaulted right  Not so fast.  Let's check what the big 3 ratings agencies have to say about it  Fitch  RD  Restricted Default  SampP SD  Selective Default  Moody's Caa1 Rated as Poor Quality and Very High Credit Risk  You notice what's missing from all of those  D  Default.  Evergrande has missed everything they can possibly miss and they're still not rated D.  Hell those brazen cockchuffers at Moody's actually have 4 separate ratings lower than what they're slapping on EG bonds.  Here let me take a second to speak in the meme language you smooth brained retards actually might understand  formatpjpgampautowebpampsd7adb931a585d603db30e2b6b8456db353404948  The reason that none of these agencies will put the D on Evergrande bonds is twofold   1 they don't want to piss off the Chinese government  2 the banks and hedge funds that are their primary clients are balls deep in this debt and can't get it off their books because shockingly people haven't forgotten how those same banks and hedge funds fucked saddled and rode them with garbage debt in 2008.  Why is this relevant to US housing equities and the margin loans financing the spiraling prices of both  Easy.  The same people who hold the worthless Chinese debt also hold trillions of dollars of equities that they've taken margin loans against to buy trillions of dollars of US Housing.  After Amazon's Q4 earngings everyone who looked into them said Holy crap  The only thing holding up their ER is this $110 Billion Rivian valuation  Some people even made memes about it on WSB pointing out that it was the only thing holding up the entire US market.  Now what happened when AMZN's Q1 ER came out and the RIVN valuation had dropped to more realistic levels  Right a 189 miss on earnings and a huge bear run on SPY and QQQ.  gtQuick shout out to those of you who like to play options on stock lockup expiries  RIVN's lockup ends on May 8th and AMZN and F have a ton of shares with a cost basis of $10 they can sell on or after that date.  The price is currently $30.  You do the math on if they want to hold onto that garbage once they can dump it at a profit.lt  That's a huge drop in the collateral backing all that margin debt.  Is it enough to cause the Mother of all Margin Calls MMC and set off the worst crash since 1929  Nope.  Not yet.  But it's coming.  Remember how people pointed out on AMZN's last ER how they were actually super fuk  Yeah you know who had a supposedly positive ER but is actually supermegafuk and just lied through their teeth about it Apple.  AAPL doesn't have a single factory working right now and their by far 1 market  China  is in the midst of complete economic collapse.  gtthe politburo doesn't have emergency meetings about giant spending packages because things are going welllt  They gave zero guidance on either of these things which makes me think that it's even worse than I think it is and I think it's fucking horrible.  But back to the bad Chinese debt. The reason Wall Street can survive a hit to something like AMZN and the indexes is that they're hedged to the balls for stuff like that.  Know what they're not hedged for  Chinese property bonds universally going to zero.  So what happens when the collateral for those margin loans goes down  I'm sure you retards behind Wendy's have all heard this one before  you get a margin call.  First you or more likely your broker sells equities.  But if equities are all dropping they comin' for that money and they're looking at your assets to get it.  Guess what  Housing and commercial real estate are both assets they can force sales on.  So that same selfreinforcing spiral that drove up both equity and real estate prices  It's going to go into reverse but here's the thing when everyone is selling at the same time prices go down really really really really really really fast.  We learned this last time in 2008.  This time because the housing market is directly tied to the crashing stocks instead of indirectly through people who will default over time as they lose their jobs or balloon payments come due or rates adjust it's going to happen all at once faster and more violently.  We actually got a brief preview of what this is going to look like thanks to the wild incompetence and greed at Zillow  Z.  Their stock crashed 40 in five days when it was revealed they'd bought too many houses they couldn't rent or flip and had to sell them at a loss.  And that was just a couple of neighborhoods in Arizona.  When this hits nationwide it's going to be exponentially worse.  How much worse  Well that depends on where you are.  Here's some graphs explaining that while the US is fuk somehow our Maple Swiling neighbors to the north are exponentially worse off  life lesson don't tie yourself to China kids.  This is bad but it's kind of hiding how bad because the data cuts off too soon after the COVID crash.  formatpjpgampautowebpampsea798013a5e45454c0be8e952c08b61ec0926728  Yeah Canada.. I'm sorry maple's.  It's gonna be rough.  Good luck and care with RBC pretty sure that between a huge position in Chinese debt and an incredible number of soon to be bad mortgages and margin loans they're completely worthless.  formatpjpgampautowebpampsc533ad7efe260d452a16e99cced6185e46b40449  Look I started writing DD's last fall saying we'd just gone into recession but nobody noticed and everyone laughed at me and said I was crazy.  After that Q1 GDP miss it looks a bit different ya  Last summer I wrote about how CMBS was fuk and it would start coming due in March 2022 and people pointed and laughed.  See the chart earlier in this post.  Now I'm telling you that the banks and the Fed and every fucking person has fucked up and missed that real estate and equities have gotten tied up in a gordian knot that's getting sucked into a black hole of failure.  I'd like to be wrong.  I've been wrong before see my terrible takes on corporate hedging of HYG for an example but I don't think I'm wrong here.  The market and housing and everything is going down like Anne Robbins trying to get off the Hollywood black list.  I've never given dates before because I didn't have a good enough idea of when things would finally hit a critical mass.  If we keep following the 2008 chart thanks for being predictable algorithms we're going to go up for a couple of weeks then crash sometime between the end of May and the middleend of July.  Summer collapses are historically rather rare so I like this fall myself but I wouldn't be surprised by either outcome.  formatpjpgampautowebpamps6b6cbdadfa3f647e7f086b32478feea9136bc500  TLDR In 2008 the unknown weapons of financial mass destruction were subprime loans MBS CDS and CDOs.  In 2022 they're margin loans asset backed loans Chinese bonds and cash purchased assets.  This is how inflation leaked into the real economy from the assets it was supposed to be segregated in.  Fed printer goes brrrrr gt assets inflate gt margin loans against assets drive up real estate gt owners of real estate suddenly have lots of extra money gt inflation.  As of November of '21 the Fed had printed $13 Trillion since the start of COVID.  $1 Trillion was stimmies.  The rest  The rest went to the rich via inflated asset prices and debt purchases.  Don't believe them when they try to blame this shitshow on stimmies and the just now convenientlymentionedinthemedia return of subprime loans bit.  They just want a chance to blame this on poor people and immigrants to avoid having anyone look at them.  And don't think JPow's greedy ass can save you this time to match the financial impact of what the Fed did during COVID they'd have to print nearly $60 Trillion.  That's Weimar Republic territory if we're not headed there already.    EDIT a lot of you aren't understanding my point which sort of proves it I guess.  Look housing is going to crash because the corps and investors and cash buyers are going to get liquidated on their margin loans when the market crashes.  That's going to free up way more supply than there is demand driving prices down.  Again this exact scenario was seen with the Zillow housing selloff last fall.  The banks and lenders and regulators literally DO NOT KNOW that these margin accounts are actually propping up housing because it doesn't show up on any of their data.

Kind of.. RH announced in the last report that revenue from Shitcoin is down 39. I took a 35 down on revenue yy from Q1 and since their transaction costs increased from 13 to 15 last year I used that to forecast next quarter.  I used Q3 2021 to estimate other costs because fuck doing the 10k and back tracking every Q I only gave this 2 hrs and I'm bored already. I also didnt go back to see what's up with taxes last year but I took an effective rate and added that.  Sorry to say ufrederickwes but Wallstreet estimates are in a wide range between .70 to 1.44 per share and even with a 35 loss in revenue COIN can easily fall into that range even with if my retarded costs analysis turns out to be wrong which I am sure it will be.  On the bright side for those who like rubbing with another dude.. Looks like if net profit goes down and 2021 turns out to be a once in a lifetime year for the company shares can be at $40 and even with a steady increase in profits but with limited growth it can justify $174  TLDR $COIN can trade up down or sideways on earnings but its a good short if profits decrease to my estimates and the price doesn't reflect it  Positions None but puts  after earnings for anything above $4050","neutral"

"AMZN A Case Study on How a Tech Megacap Stalwart Falls From Grace","So I had time enough this past weekend to really analyze AMZN's most recent earnings and read between the lines.  What I found actually bodes well in terms of giving a leg up for smaller companies against all the macro headwinds so bulls your poor bussys can have a rest.

Hear me out and listen closely you fucking single digit IQ twatwaffles.  Maybe you'll actually come out in the green for once in your pathetic mom's basement dwelling life.  Pull up last weeks chart with the 8 EMA 21 EMA and 50 SMA overlaid with daily candles along with Bollingers and Heiken Ashis as reference so you can follow along.

"Sunday Brunch Chartbook Recent Market Performance and Analysis"," In this post I'll run down through various charts  indices ETFs some single stocks  to try to create some insight into the market. We're trying to establish some notion of what's doing well what's not doing well and what some market indicators might be telling us.   I try to refrain from making outright conclusions or providing explicit trade ideas. Instead I'm walking through how different asset classes and sectors are performing and highlighting some interesting and relevant indicators all in an effort to give a more holistic picture of the market to help you make better informed trades.  Previous Edition  Let's get started...   Indices  SPY 1yformatpngampautowebpamps609549fae067039aa75725c72b5012fada2329d4  SPY 3yformatpngampautowebpampsf0014dae8c5a194c9646aec3b51741c1b74812eb   After breaking below the 420 level earlier this week we closed well below it on heavy volume on Friday. This relative level has been support throughout this downtrend and I think Friday's move finally sets us up to continue lower.  Many have pointed out the next logical level of support is around the 400405 level which is definitely in reach. Below that we're probably looking at 380ish or if you're ultra bearish you could make the case for a retrace to the 200DMA around 350.      QQQ 1yformatpngampautowebpamps445f7266b70408652c87da9066bf1f7e35e5260a  QQQ 3yformatpngampautowebpamps71e36b6efdd1dd4d27cda6392a25126380cfd756   Looking at similar timeframes on QQQ we're seeing the same thing a break below recent support around 320 with the next level probably around 300 or 290.      IWM 3yformatpngampautowebpampsf9703f192138dfce36c27b7fd03000b66cdfaeba   IWM in my opinion has really been the leader  canary in the coal mine here. It was range bound for much of 2021 and it's failed breakout in November was really the start of this down trend at the index level many stocks were down throughout 2021.   Earlier this year it broke through the bottom end of it's 2021 trading range as selling spread to the other indices and never managed to bounce back up. It didn't really participate in that massive rip in the second half of March which I thought was an obvious red flag.    Now it's broken below it's lower range  with 190192 being lower support  and I think we're headed for it's precovid high of 170   Since we started to fade that March rally it's been my stance that we're headed lower and if we're to believe there's no such thing as triple bottoms then the target was always to break under these recent support levels.    I think the impetus here is we've finally started to see the mega cap tech names that have held up these indices so well roll over. People have lately been pointing out that we've seen these drawdowns start in the shittiestriskiest areas of the market  e.g. SPACs at the start of last year  and move down the risk curve and ultimately nothing is safe. This is generally how a bear market happens.      RUA 5yformatpngampautowebpamps9b74710de4050b6e3bb695cc8e8befd96b74da41   Lastly looking at the RUA  the Russel 3000  virtually the entire US stock market  my guess is we're likely to visit that 2300 area in the nearterm.    Sectors  Sector Performance 6mformatpngampautowebpamps1151356ed7d2ec95af19aed9a084907829eef251   This is a pretty busy but handy chart I look at to give me an idea of relative performance across many market sectors. It's been useful the last few years as we've had a ton of rotation between different areas of the market and this can help me spot that and trade momentum accordingly.  Last week I noted some recent relative outperformance of sector defensive sectors like healthcare energy and consumer staples. We're actually starting to see those now succumb to the selling endemic in the rest of the market.  If our overall recession  bear case is valid then this is expected and unfortunately we may have to act like nothing is safe.      XLU 1yformatpngampautowebpampsdaab669046da193e1d8bfa2c0abe1fab40ffc9db   I also previously noted the outperformance of utilities which usually do not perform well in a rising rate environment. Well we've seen them give back the entirety of their recent move and these could very well be heading back lower as often happens with a failed breakout.     XLI 5yformatpngampautowebpamps1d95d47df758da897a3c1f109e7b2bae9f00c777   I also previously talked about Dow theory and the relationship between industrials and utilities  industrials never confirmed the breakout in utilities and are now actually looking like they're breaking lower from the range they've been stuck in for a year. This is also pretty bearish.   Oof this week has not been good...   Bonds Dollar Sentiment  US10Y All Timeformatpngampautowebpamps0d6986636fd1a990f73e852d32185a1ba77c6e1d   Whatever way you draw the trend line we're breaking out above it. Bond volatility has continued this week alone trading in a 20bps range. Will we finally find some resistance here around 3 and take a breather      DXY alltimeformatpngampautowebpamps165b58f99571cfe2913e0cb0e22ddad08549bb8b   The DXY or US dollar index has been talked about much lately. We've had historic moves in currency pairs and the DXY is an index of the US dollar vs a basket of other major currencies most notably the Euro. I wanted to zoom out here to give an idea of just how historic this move is  the DXY above 100 is notable and this past week we broke above the 102 level which has been the top level of the range we've been in since 2015.   This is notable because there are all sorts of trades that can start to blow up as these FX moves continue and these can introduce or exacerbate all kinds of volatility in all kinds of financial assets. Basically this can get really fucking bad really fucking quick and does not portend well for markets across the world.      AAII Sentiment Surveyformatpngampautowebpampsb34bd4b268c5fcfef07adeb29bd8a10725f999f6   Sentiment got even worse this past week which can be expected given the price action.   Sentiment has been much talked about lately but despite the overall bearish sentiment indicated by various surveys  indicators there's not been a real indication of a washout  heavy indiscriminate selling and panic that can indicate max capitulation and a possible bottom.      NYSE New Highs vs Lowsformatpngampautowebpamps0519b10faf3bb1c820c551a837f35413c6fa3a91   NYSE new lows in orange are still elevated while stocks making new highs in blue are basically nonexistent. Interestingly even with all that selling on Friday we saw the new lows decrease  that might be an indication that Friday's selling was very much in stocks that have been holding up well and not in those that have already been making new lows which reinforces this idea that selling is spreading to all parts of the market at this point.    Some Thoughts  I think we're getting to some conditions where we have to start entertaining the idea that this isn't just a pullback  correction but instead the start of a bear market and a very series correction. This would be an extreme bearish view but something like 350 on SPY would represent a 26 drawdown and 50 fib retracement of the covid rally from the March 2020 lows to the recent top which would actually be reasonable if we see a true washout  market conditions are there to really exacerbate selling.    Now I've no clue if this will happen but I'd expect we first have to break meaningfully below that 40004050 level on SPX.   Earningswise while Q1 reports have been great Q2 guidance has been somewhat poor. We're likely to see continued supply chain problems with China unable to cope with covid inflationary pressures and uncertainty likely to hit consumer and business sentimentbehavior and lastly the macro challenge with the dollar's strength and Europe and other countries entering a recession.    I have some expectation we'll see companies freezing hiring and laying off employees we're already seeing this having overcompensated for the last few years and now needing to readjust based on normalizing demand whatever the new normal is and facing margin pressures and uncertainty due to the macro picture.   Suffice to say I think Q2 earnings are going to be garbage but hopefully we'll see things get better in the second half of this year.   Of course I price is the best indication of sentiment and I may have a completely different view by this time next week.","negative"
"Coinbase Price Target Analysis","Hello everyone I prepared a valuation analysis for this stock and wanted to share my results   First of all I went onto nomics.com and downloaded the historical trading volumes for coinbase. I took the daily trading volumes for each day of the first quarter and summed them up. The total dollar amount of trading activity on Coinbase for Q1 2022 was $307744400239.   I then looked at Coinbase most recent quarterly report the Q4 2021 report. Listed in this report is the financials and trading volumes for the 5 preceding quarters. The trading volumes went as such Q4 2020  89B Q1 2021  335B Q2 2021  462B Q3 2021  $327B Q4 2021  547B.   I then looked at the net trading revenues from these quarters and they go as follows 497M 1.597B 2.033B 1.235B and 2.49B. I divided the revenues by the associated trading volumes for each quarter to get what percentage of trading volume was collected as fee revenue. This rate was fairly similar in all quarters and averaged to be 0.461615. This means that 0.461615 of trading volume has historically been collected as fee revenue for Coinbase. Applying this historic percentage to Q1 2022s trading volume of 307744400239  we find that the net trading revenues would be $1420592930.09.   Well this is just the projected revenue for this quarter but how about the earnings   Well the quarterly report also shows the profitability of Coinbase for the 5 preceding quarters and they go as such Q4 2020  Revenue of 497M and Net Income of 177M. Q1 2021  Revenue 1.597B NI 771M. Q2 2021  Revenue 2.033B NI 1.606B. Q3 2021  Revenue 1.235B NI 406M. Q4 2021  Revenue 2.490B NI 840M. I then divided the net income by the revenues to find the profit margin and they are all pretty similar across all the listed quarters. The profitability is around 3240 each quarter besides Q2 2021 where profitability was a whopping 78.99656. That quarter was definitely an outlier to the positive side. However I wanted my valuation to be VERY conservative so I decided to completely cut out this positive outlier as it pulled the average profit margin much higher. Including this outlier the average profit margin was 45.8995388 without the outlier it was an average of 37.70407. We will use that conservative average and make that our base case profit margin. In order to account for possible increases or decreases in profitability I constructed a three case analysis. I took the average historic profit margin 37.70407 as the base case a significantly lower profit margin of 30 which is lower than ANY previous quarter as my conservative case and a 40 higher end of historical margins as my generous or best case.   The three cases came to the following potential net incomes for Q1 2022 Conservative case $426177879.03 Base case $535621393.47 GenerousBest case $568237172.04.   I then took these three potential cases of quarterly profit and calculated the forward PE ratios at the three different earnings levels. The conservative margins equate to an annual net income earnings of 1704711516.11 for 2022 the base case annual net income is 2142485573.89 for 2022 the generousbest case annual net income is 2272948688.14 for 2022.   This means that at the current price level of Coinbase the forward PEs would be 14.67110403 for the conservative case 11.67335748 for the base case and 11.00332803 for the best case.   We then have to decide what multiple the market will accept as a fair multiple for Coinbase. Coinbase is a fintech company in the cryptocurrency space and therefore commands a higher multiple. Many fintech stocks trade at a 200 multiple other more established brands such as Visa and Mastercard trade around 3545. Others such as Paypal are currently trading around 25. Due to the many macroeconomic and geopolitical factors weighing on market valuations at the moment I decided to be VERY conservative with my anticipated multiples just as I was VERY conservative with my revenue and profit margins. I decided due to the uncertainty and the rerating of multiples in the market to set the conservative case as a multiple of 20 the base case as a multiple of 30 and the best case as a multiple of 40. As I mentioned these anticipated multiples are VERY conversative but are realistic due to the newness of the company and the pessimism weighing on the markets. So even the best case comes in lower than their fintech peers current market multiples.   I then created a rubric in which one side had the three forward PEs I calculated the generous base and best case forward PEs and the other side had the three anticipated accepted market multiples the generous base and best case PEs. I then calculated within this rubric the percentage difference between the three calculated forward PEs with the three anticipated market multiples creating nine potential outcomes.   Using the conservative forward PE calculation there would have to be an increase of 36.3224 to get to the conservative multiple a 104.4836 increase to get to the base case multiple and a 72.6448 increase to get to the best case multiple.  Using the base case forward PE calculation there would have to be a 71.33 increase to get to the conservative multiple a 156.9955 increase to get to the base case multiple and a 242.6606 increase to get to the best case multiple. Then for the best case forward PE calculation there would need to be a 81.7632 increase to get to the conservative multiple an 172.6448 increase to get to the base case multiple and a 263.526 increase to get to the best case multiple.     I then created another rubric in which I evaluated the percent chance of each of these cases happening.  There are a total of 9 potential cases because there are three cases of what their forward PE is calculated to be and three different cases of what the ACCEPTED and tradeable multiple is in the market.  Being VERY conservative again I believe there is a 40 chance the conservative forward PE calculation is correct a 40 chance the base case forward PE calculation is correct and a 20 chance the best case forward PE calculation is correct.  Then on the other axis I believe there is a 40 chance the accepted market multiple will be on the conservative side of 20PE a 40 chance of the accepted market multiple being the base case of 30PE and a 20 chance of the accepted market multiple being the best case of 40PE.     Cross multiplying these percentage chances within the table gives us the following percentage chances across the nine possibilities A 16 that both the earnings AND the market multiple will be the conservative case. A 16 chance that the earnings will be conservative but the market multiple will be base case. An 8 chance that the earnings will be conservative but the market multiple will be best case. A 16 chance that the earnings will be base case but the market multiple will be conservative.  A 16 chance that both the earnings AND the market multiple will be base case.  An 8 chance that the earnings will be base case but the market multiple will be best case. A 8 chance that the earnings will be best case but the market multiple will be conservative.  An 8 chance that the earnings will be best case but the market multiple will be base case.  And a 4 chance that both the earnings AND the market multiple will be best case.     I then combined the two rubrics the percentage increase in stock value for the nine possible outcomes and the probability of the nine outcomes and multiplied the associated stock increase by the anticipated probability of that outcome.  This gives us a probability adjusted price target for coinbase across all nine potential outcomes.     Once you add all these probability adjusted outcomes together you get a 123.179209 anticipated increase of stock price.  Going off the current price levels in which our calculations were based that means that the 2022 earnings adjusted price target for Coinbase should be $251.55share.     All of these calculations began by using the ACTUAL trading volumes.  We KNOW that the trading volume for Q1 2022 was 307744400239.  The rest of these calculations were based on historic figures and profit margins.  In order to account for the pessimistic tones of the market and economic headwinds I used VERY conservative margins.  In order to adjust for potential discrepancies in margins and forward PEs I used three cases for margins and three cases for market multiples.  I accounted for EVERY possible outcome.  I firmly believe that even on a conservative note this stock is very oversold.  The IPO price was WAY too high I agree.  But this demolition of Coinbase stock price is unwarranted and completely manipulative.      The fair value of Coinbase stock by the end of this year should be $251.55.  This is right on with how the stock traded through May 2021  October 2021 before the market unjustifiably destroyed the stock.  There IS potentially upside of 123.179209 on this stock at current levels.  And I rate Coinbase a strong buy.","neutral"
"MBB a triple A rated MBS ETF has crashed and made a new all time low under the 2008 housing crash. Worst quarter performance ever by far. Mortgage departments everywhere seeing layoffs. And as a bonus Fannie Mae executives are jumping ship","Comes in a half hour video form with all the data presented in it. This is not a prediction this has already happened. In the video i go through what's inside MBB as well as go through Fannie's 8k filings which shows there's been a slew of execs leaving and new ones being appointed like a new CFO and Chief Risk Officer culminating in both the chair of the board and the CEO since 2018 leaving as was announced in April.    If you need a slightly shorter explanation of what happened in 3 minutes just watch this but replace double A with triple A.    Link where you can check the data for yourself within a minute scroll down to holdings download Holdings Supplemental Information and Search All for FICO and ask yourself if that looks triple A and if they would pull the same crap with bonds where the names don't even tell you anything  search for LTV as a bonus. Same page also has the credit exposure breakdown at the bottom to show it's triple A rated    And finally to prove to you apes that I did pull a Michael Burry and in the exact same asset class none the less here's a video i did on the subject in March 2021 when literally everybody was going into housing and the CPI hadn't even blown out yet another thing i got right    And some tweets to show i was on the case just didn't get much attention at the time. After the worst quarter in the history of credit in the US though things might be different. We'll see how this thread does.  Looking at the CUSIPS of what's in MBB    And coming across the DTCC cutting margin collateral for MBS    If you're wondering what's next QT. When the Fed shrinks the balance sheet by selling MBS back into the market they'll be selling tens of billions each month. Last number i heard was $35 billion a month.  MBB has $10 billion in assets. They'd sell 35 ENTIRE ETFs into the market. Per month. The entire credit market already started plunging from the moment they openly started discussing QT at the start of January. If Jerome Powell is actually crazy enough to do it all hell's going to break loose. The QE that follows will be monstrous just to keep the system from seizing up a la 2008.  Only bigger than 2008 because both Freddie and Fannie's guarantee book of business has grown Freddie doubled from $15 Trillion in 2014 to $3 trillion now  and it's actually fixed rate mortgages that are the problem thanks to inflation. Aside from people being unable to pay their mortgage even when fixed due to other living costs going up we all know inflation inflates away a mortgage when it's fixed.  But have any of you ever wondered who's on the other end of that trade And whether or not that might be a good thing at maximum system fragility with leverage being as high as it is  If your mortgage is 4 fixed and inflation is 85  who's going to eat the 45 difference  The bond holder. Or in this case  the holder of slices of bonds the MBS holder. And inflation affects the entire system including triple A. The only way to fix it To raise rates which'd also mean raise mortgage costs which means a further seizing up of the housing market no starter can pay these prices PLUS a gt4 mortgage and either forced selling or forced bailouts. Considering what the selling would lead to i'd say bailouts are inevitable.","negative"

"How Banks rip us off and no jail","I know all brokers have different policies and in Canada i use TD.  TD forces me to sell my contract on day of expiry at 3 pm. Now sometimes what they forget to do it because theres been times my contract disapears ten minutes to four or not at all like they forgot or something.   Am I paranoid to think they sell my contracts to them selves holding until who knows what time they have to sell them back to the sec.   They do this if they see potential gain some how before the contract expires and if its a who cares but if theres a gain poof they pocket our money.

"$ABNB earnings play 53 DD","Gather around my fellow degenerates I have a totally well researched earnings play on ABNB that cannot possibly fail.  The general idea is this stock price too high stock price fall soon.  You will be purchasing puts if you want to participate.    You might remember that ABNB started trading in 2021 at over double its initial offering price during the absolute peak of IPO mania.    ETF that tracks recent IPO performance. formatpngampautowebpamps1c4488bd751f21e37ed5d7ea182d454e6e5a0995  While the majority of IPO's in 20202021 have heavily corrected ABNB and segments of the travel industry at large have remained stubbornly overvalued.    ampx200B  ABNB 1 year chart note the support at $130. formatpngampautowebpampsef55b7b6073df0cee7b83228a293d0af2e341a57  The stock market recently has punished tech companies that were priced beyond perfection.  ABNB has avoided this fate and is only down roughly 10 YTD.  I think they have avoided the carnage because they are in the travel industry which is significantly overvalued.  For example  $MAR is trading above precovid levels at a PE of over 50  $BKNG is trading above precovid levels at a PE of almost 80.    ABNB has a PE of nothing because they are an unprofitable tech company with a market cap of 100B.

"The Game is Over Canada  Also World War 3","TLDR Everything is going to burn down around you but its okay because the banks will profit. This is mostly for Canada as I havent looked into the situation in the US nearly as much but it could potentially apply there too.  Where we are now  The stock market is in a bubble or a bull run. Whatever you call it its the same result. People banks and institutions use their holdings as leverage to purchase houses. They dont just buy one house. They buy 3 or 4. Foreign buyers own properties that sit empty just because they offer a better return on investment than the market. The extra houses get rented out and used to generate income. The buyer stops working and lives off the rental income or airbnb income. This creates artificial demand for housing. This drives up the cost of housing increasing the leverage needed. People take out bigger and bigger loans. This also results in record profits for companies because more people are in a position to buy goods. The cost of goods is artificially lowered. The lower demand on the job market results in wage inflation because companies have to offer higher wages to attract new employees. Banks raise interest rates. Banks here are raising interest rates to try to pull the plug on the situation below but its too late.  Where its going  The stock market goes through a correction. It doesnt have to be a major correction either. What matters is the duration. The correction just has to go on long enough for people to default on their loans. Those who bought 3 or 4 houses basically on margin have to default. They sell some of their additional homes. To make sure their remaining assets are secure they are also forced to sell some of their holdings. This pushes the price of stocks down further. Which makes even those who only took out much lower loans earlier on also have to default. Foreign buyers panic sell at a loss relative to market value but not overall loss. The price of housing starts to go down due to increased selling pressure. Small businesses run by people with loans leveraging the homes and other properties they actually own are no longer able to use their homes as collateral for funding because the valuation is now much lower. Businesses go under and there are now more people looking for work. There are more people selling stocks to make ends meet in the interim. People who were living off rental income need to go back into the job market as well either because they were living off one rental property or because they need the supplemental income to be able to continue to finance the mortgages. The demand on the rental market increases driving up rents. There is also now a lower supply of rentals as well further driving up the price. Companies watch their profits evaporate as there is a huge drop in disposable income of any kind. This results in layoffs and budget cuts further reducing the need for employees. So at the same time that the market tanks housing tanks rents go up wages go down businesses go under and unemployment increases. Which will also result in a massive market selloff the likes of which have probably never been seen before. The whole thing will become self perpetuating. As the market sells off the housing sells off which causes more of a market sell off which causes more of a housing sell off which causes more unemployment and more people needing to rent which reduces spending power cuts into profits and lowers wages further. The whole thing just spirals. The only factor slowing it down at first is people who were waiting to buy houses piling in but that will eventually reverse when most of them are unemployed or the cost of goods rises too high and they too are forced to default. The only commodities that go down in price will be cars and gas as their profit margins literally depended on this whole system to stay in place and they fuelled most of this growth by allowing the urban sprawl that allowed the growth to happen in the first place.  How the game ends  The banks win because they now own most of the property in the country. The stock market is collapsed and wont recover for decades. The housing market is collapsed and wont recover for decades. There is a shortage of jobs. Rents are still inflated as there is now a huge demand. Wages are the lowest theyve ever been. The cost of all goods and services goes up. We enter the biggest depression ever.  What is the solution  No economy is stronger than a postwar economy. The government would have no choice but to engage in some sort of a conflict. The more people are enlisted and overseas the better the situation gets back home. The more young people get sent overseas to fight a war the less people are at home plotting to overthrow the government which allowed this all to happen. The less mouths there are to feed back home the more the economic problems suddenly solve themselves as it balances out supply and demand possibly permanently as the majority of soldiers wont make it back home. War is also a good distraction. A common enemy is always a uniting factor.  Closing  Im not sure how serious I am about all of this. But it does from this vantage point look like a distinct possibility. Maybe this should be on rconspiracy instead.

"Archegos and DTCC","So today DTCC release this    So it seems harmless and the same as before BUT this caught my eye  In general Section 23A and Regulation W limit the aggregate amount of covered transactions between a bank and any single affiliate of the bank. Covered transactions include among other things a banks acceptance of securities or other debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral security for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company. Thus to avoid running afoul of the restrictions imposed by Section 23A and Regulation W the LOC Agreement excludes Lender FIS as eligible collateral.

"We can either be pulling the rug or standing on it. It's time retail squeeze the Fed to explode volatility.","The markets are teetering right now and in the most vulnerable state we've seen them in possibly decades.   The Fed has been cheating the market with artificial liquidity to suppress volatility and deceive the system to keep things intact for years.  Anyone who has been  watching for the past few weeks has seen the control being lost as this slow motion rug pull has been unfolding.  The writingformatpngampautowebpampsd42eb68f00af67a6afad37582123d3277c940409 has been on the wallcropsmartampautowebpampsac9d6e950e4eee72579c27c5b0b7427962971dbc for some time whether we want to accept it or not.  Things are going to get worse likely much worse.   We can sit by and hope for the best while Chad throws it our wife or we can try to collectively influence and have a part in what takes place by getting ready in advance.  It's about time that we try and flip the script for once and pour some gasoline on the smoldering trash can the market is turning into.  It's not as crazy as it sounds.  Here's how we could actually pull this off.   Retail has a rather unique opportunity in the weeks and month ahead to exploit this fragility to pressure the Fed as it undergoes tightening using their own market control apparatus alongside them.    Our weapon Volatility.  Specifically a unified weeks long retail exodus against all long positions and an immediate transfer of capital onto VIX and its' derivatives alongside collective spyindex puts as it climbs and we do so immediately after they exhaust efforts to stabilize the market this coming week.  Positions   A sudden retail liquidation and exiting from all bleeding long holds. Except squeeze plays on Monday afternoon en masse and keep an eye out as the Fed is forced to release containment on market volatility we exacerbate the  pressure for the price climb with a sustained increase into callshare volume on VIXYUVXYVXX.  And then reinforce with SPYindex short puts once VIX containment efforts bottoms out towards end of day or the following morning and begins to release.  For the record I do not believe what we do will force anything from happening that wasn't already going to.  This process is going to play out regardless of any retail involvement we will merely help accelerate things into being far less controlled and get ourselves positioned on the correct side of it.  The Reserve is in a controlled but a  mandatory fight with VIX to maintain market stability entirely due to their own requirements.  The demands of their ongoing tightening measures will continue to see more of the debt they've created within the market to be pulled back through the indexes it supported the effect of which will be a VIX that demands to climb further and rejects sustained downward control.  ampx200B  A collectively informed retail has the ability to help force feed a process that is already underway.     Buy your positions back in a month they won't be taking off without you anytime soon.","negative"

I think I let you all down. This understanding of the stock market that i had in my head that fundamental analysis is nothing compared to technical analysis and i could just cut all the background noise by just simply looking at the charts. I thought why in the world should I crunch numbers that these Wall Street HFs and institutions try to do. Im so better than this. So I keep going to bars and having drinks partying all night using tinder etc thinking when an exit liquidity rally to ATH comes about in JulyAugust 2022 I will short the entire market. And soon Wall Street will remember me as the only guy who saw it all coming to the perfect date.  So I created this illusion in my head that in Q4 2022 we will 10000 get our recession because the liquidity in the market was starting to decrease. So I told literally every huge player on Wall Street about this macro idea. I also try to impose my thoughts on each one of you that in Q4 we will have a recession.  But I got so deluded into my illusionary world that I never tried to calculate could we be early to a recession even before Q4.   Now it turns out we could. 2Q of ve GDP could come by July. Its a 50 chance though. Meaning if it happens i ain't gonna get the glory for this crisis. Jeremy Grantham and Michael Burry are.

Can't we all just simply short the market and make insane amounts of money in the way down. Turns out it ain't easy as it seems. Now you have got to be dealing with what we call turbulence in the market. We may go up and down go up and down. Meaning options are pretty much useless in the market. The only choice you have got is swing trading in futures or the normal market.  So find a favorite youtuber who predicted all the things in the market like Recession bond drought commodity shock stock market crash etc. And if you cant find the guy then how about reading my piece below and heck even sharing with your friends about how this guy was so close to figuring it all out but he was just too damn lazy for wallstreet fast life.   Don't try to give me a job in Dms unless you're a Warren Buffet. I love flying solo and cleaning the toilets at Black Rock. Yes i love my job.    ampx200B  So now we shall discuss the three questions that need answering      Q1  How much is J powell gonna raise rates.  So my readers know how I dont just give out my secrets that easily. I need you all to work too and come to your own conclusions. So in my last post I gave you all the homework that what was the third observation in the chart below.  ampx200B  Homework Chart  Yellow lines  Wage inflation  Red line  CPI inflation  White  FED rate hikeformatpngampautowebpamps5fcb1c6c62e6b2af53f83506c3349f5cd1bd4126  The answer to that question is FED has to raise rates at least the half of what CPI annualized inflation is or almost equal to it. Although some might argue the Taylor rule states that its actually double but seriously my charts don't lie to me.  So now you all must be wondering okay so half of say like 8 is 4. What's the big fuss about. Turns out technically your 4 is gonna go to a maximum of 8 due to IHS and trend lines breaks.   ampx200B  formatpngampautowebpamps0d136ac9bb1ccfcc2d4c71b5617bff9a2f51f5d6  So idk what fundamental analysis or news comes around will led to such technicals. But the chart is telling me that the 10yr bonds are going to 6 to 8 by 2023 but the terminal rates are still projecting 3.2 by Aug 23. We have got room considering the labor market is robust and strong.  Hypothesis 1  Terminal rates projection will go to 6 by Aug 2023.  Heres the calculation on how it could.  50X6  3  0.25  3.25 by eoy.  5 X 0.50  2.5  Total  5.75  ampx200B  So what impact will it have   Almost certainly you're gonna get recession coz you will be raising rates in a contracting economy.  ampx200B  At the end of large cycles we have Recessionformatpngampautowebpampse8c1abbf5a3effd16fca362fc109443e055ae0c4  Hypothesis 2  FEDU turns and doesn't raise rates over 2  Welcome to Japan where you keep your bond yields down inflate the dollar by printing even more and send all your assets to the moon.  ampx200B  Note  Million Dollar Advise  Lets also look at a GDP chart over here which only the few selected people on Wall Street know about.  ampx200B  GDP negative  print vs Stock Market crashformatpngampautowebpampsc4f8de83709aef26c240cf187fe5acce0fb3a957  This chart tells us well the first negative print is priced in the market. Question now remains whether the next GDP nos are going to be positive or negative.    If we are going to get positive nos by July then the stock market should go up in Q2.    if we are gonna get that 2nd negative print and complete the definition of 2Q of negative GDP growth you're talking about 50 in Q2 itself.   So you have got a lot of number crunching to do with big banks and institutions reading my post. Retailers don't try it. Just keep buying the dip with cash i told you to accumulate. Don't rush in coz buying stocks this year is going to be like buying groceries. Or you can just place your first two orders at 30 amp 40 and cancel the noise.  ampx200B  Q2  How much will Bond get destroyed  We have talked about this in  Credit risk america  post that bonds are to be bought bw May 16 June 16. At least that's what historical technicals in TLT are telling me which is an iShare 20yr ETF.   As for 10yr bonds idk guys. This bond is tricky. It follows the terminal rate which is currently 3.2. My calculation says 6. So more selloff I guess.  ampx200B  Terminal Rateformatpngampautowebpamps596d6e54b6360f23d350f75fd52a0489bb19452f  Remember  iShare is historical pattern and 10yr bonds is current T.A. pattern. One of them will be right. Its either gonna be buying bonds buying at may 15june 15 or buying bonds at 6 or 8 terminal rates.  ampx200B  Q3  How much lower will stocks go  Well honestly speaking we are 100 going into a severe recession coz Jim Cramer said recession is gonna be mild. So 50 from the top.   We will talk more about this later or you can just check my last post for this   ampx200B  Q4  What is coming Short Recession Stagflation Depression   First will come stagflation coz we money printed so much in 2020. It takes 2yr for full effect of monetary policy plus supply inflation from China not Russia because China went into lockdown mode meaning less demand for oil and gas. Hence they will go down. No comments about other commodity.  Now we are tightening so deflation will come from 2023 to 2025 if the FED went with a rate hike to 4. We will also get our forgotten depression of 1921 somewhere around here for 1yr which is also called as longerlasting recession for more than 1yr. Lets see how it all unfolds.  ampx200B  Q5  What's the big deal with Liquidity  For this I suggest first watching Ray Dalio's video about how the economy works.  Remember HFs have access to a liquidity pool. Then we have pension funds on top of it. And on top of them we have VCs and on top of them private equity. And at last we have retailers.  Then analyze these charts below and come to your own conclusion.  These charts are by the author of Capital Wars who is considered the father of liquidity   ampx200B  ampx200B  ampx200B  60 months bond market theoryformatpngampautowebpampsdd70903c45482e683792b8599c8a560aa15c9a6b  We are currently in turbulenceformatpngampautowebpamps0e86b69ad5adaa395b8e6d63fa2daf1cf864633f  ampx200B  ampx200B  But how about Q6 that no one of you is asking or thinking about it This shall be your H.W.  Q6  What's up with Forex market    Especially japan and euro.  tSOPpcPJ3779w1niMvdFf6gtSOPpcPJ3779w1niMvdFf6g  Remember  Dollar is strengthening meaning other currencies will lose its value more in dollars if they are not starting the tightening cycle. Hence JPY is getting destroyed. For Euro well wars and recession make it bad for investors to hold the EURO.  ampx200B  ampx200B  So again with lots of love. Keep enjoying your time. Remember to take the vacations in May like institutions would.  ampx200B  Thank you.  Sorry for ending weirdly. I'm a weirdo who is tired. I wanna go back and watch my animes and shows until institutions and HFs destroy my wonderful America. Don't know whose orders they are operating but it all seems like a planned attack on liquidity.

"Deutsche Bank Put Option play because they fail to deliver GME in EU","Jooo what up half degenerate half autistic WSB gang  dont think Im trying to do some Dr. Burry shit I was just having this idea and wanted to share it with u. This is what this sub was about or nah  A friend of mine tried to do a basic free of payment transfer of long GMEs from deutsche Banks broker Maxblue to IBKR to finally DRS them. If u dont know about DRS u should catch up and secure ur assets before shit hits the fan.  Anyways the initial transfer was Oktober 21. since then they didnt respond to mails neither from my friend nor the INBOUND broker IBKR. They booked Shares of and they literally disappeared for a few weeks and so on. My friend Contacted the German SEC BaFin and a lawyer they r waiting still probably suing but hoping still to get things done.  If a major prime broker still cant deliver securities wich they should have but clearly fail to deliver does it make sense to buy puts  In this case $DB.   This is not financial advise","negative"

"ESTE  But I need help","Dear WSB  Thanks for having me on... long time listener first time caller.  After losing about all my savings trading options a few years ago I concluded I'm too dumb to have control of my own money so after I saved up again I gave it to someone with a basic education and a nice suit he promised he wouldn't touch my wife. However turns out this guy wasn't great at it either... after 2 years my money had neither grown nor lost it all. And so came the time now when my wife and I were in a position to buy our first house. Of course asking for our savings back coincided with the recent market selloff and the portfolio was down a little. It turns out that our BMWdriving finance guy scared for his reputation had tried to recoup the $3000 loss on $200k by going nearly allin on ESTE. That $3000 quickly turned into $30000.   This $200k was to be our down payment we worked hard to save that both Greek immigrants and now I'm facing falling out of escrow because I don't have enough funds to meet the mortgage broker's requirements for the underwriting. The deadline is this week.  To avoid losing our first home and my wife leaving me which ape do I need to send her nudes to in order to arrange for some GMEstyle action on ESTE I haven't done any DD on ESTE but I guess my Frappuccinosipping finance guy has so there could actually be some underlying value under the hood.  So is there a chance to rally the troops Or do I just start looking for oneman tents  Yours meekly","negative"

"Sell $Z puts","They wrote down their 4.5 billion in home inventory last quarter. I believe it was a 250m loss on top of other write downs before. They are now going to reverse mostall of that and post a surprise gain. Liquidity in market is still an issue so could be a muted bump to price and IV is high. Also even if the quarter is great managment kay just provide meh guidance. So instead of buying calls we put IV on our side and sell puts a few months out.  Be careful when picking the puts to sell with the price difference between buying and selling. A big difference means there isn't much liquidity so selling it might be tough even if you are right. Go into this thinking worst case scenario I get Zillow shares super cheap it's already cheap or I get a few hundred from selling the puts. You may have to wait out the whole time on the put.  Unlike open door and redfin Zillow makes around 250m in cash flow per quarter for their normal biz operations. That's $1 billion annualized on a 10 billion market cap. They have a boatload of cash and home inventory but also debt. Either way fair value with ibuying gone is 15 billion.  They messed up with their ibuying but have been saved by inflation. Look at posts in this subreddit to see the mood on housing. We want to inverse them and the rest of the people who don't know how to read financial statements and look at the reality of home pricesactivity the past 3 months along with unemployment.   1 of portfolio.","positive"

"Why i think these Home price collapse apes are likely full of shit","Why i think you're most likely full of shit.  This is off the top of my head.  Also Strictly for the United States.  1. The increase in home purchase via cash was do to record low interest rates Not just during covid but going back all the way to 2012'ish 2. Rental prices in most populated areas have spiked due to lack of housing being available.  Where will all these people go unlike in 2008 where most fled to rentals to nurse their wounds. 3. People bought homes whether homestead or investment with locked in low interest rates.  Allowing them to save a significant amount of money on their mortgage or maximize their profits on the already strapped rental economy In many areas not all obviously 4. To tie in with 3.  I've never seen companies so hard up for employees.  Sure this could absolutely change.  But given the salaries some of these companies are offering.  I feel like many people would be interested.  They aren't  apparently they've found alternative incomes during covid No data to back that up but it's the only thing that appears to make sense.  Since there is no way a couple thousand dollars lasted people 5 or 6 months. 5. What exactly do you think would cause people to dump their rental properties or investment holdings that could be turned into rental properties.  When they're paying 2  3 interest and rental prices are skyrocketing In many areas  My personal shit opinion is that there will be a correction.  But nothing even close to resembling a crash.  Just some areas will cool down.  While others essentially continue along the same path without such a steep incline in home prices.  This shit never happens the way most of us peasants think it will.  Someone is sitting out there with a pair of aces though.  They're in the business and they know.  Reading articles is useless.   They'll never be forthcoming.","negative"
"Ruble what's happening with it and what will be happening in the future","So I've seen many people naively shorting Russian ruble so I thought I could express some my thoughts regarding this question as someone living in Russia and being interested in economics.   Ruble's current state  At MOEX Moscow Exchange we can buysell dollar for 7072 rubles and eur for 7578. This makes ruble technically more worth than it was before the war.  There's no such thing that we're not allowed to have foreign currency or that we pay 1230 for buying it it was a thing a few weeks ago but currently cancelled. But there's still a lot of limitations...   Why is it worth so much  Definitely not because our gov is playing 5 d chess. There are heavy limitations imposed such as  1. You can't cash out it 2. You can't transfer money abroad except $ 10k to your relatives or smh like that 3. ETFs of foreign companies are still not traded 4. Foreigners couldn't sell their assets from what I've seen they can now yet to be confirmed 5. Russians can't buy many foreign goods    1. Because of ban of visa and mastercard can't pay for google pay apple store steam etc.    2. Also many flights are cancelled so no reason to buy euro to spend in Europe if can't fly to Europe 6. Businesses still have to sell 80 of their foreign currency income 7. High deposit interest rates to make people prefer deposit to investing  The listed limitations obviously harm the economy more than if the ruble was let floating.  There are also reserves gold gas for rub and probably many more which keep ruble high.   Is it gonna fall  I think yes. Like I said the central bank and gov are going to eventually loosen the exchange rate.  If we look into the past back to events of early 2014 you can check that despite sanctions ruble only started falling on September 2014 half a year after the Crimea annexation.  This means that the gov held it for some time artificially and then when everything was settled let it go from 33 rub per usd peaked to almost 70 and then bounced between 55 and 70.  My bet 90 rub per dollar by 2023.","negative"
